Speaker Boehner said that he is considering the bill from the Senate because the original GOP transportation bill failed to build majority support in the House Read Here.\nThe bill includes provisions that help fund the highways and road development projects trucking companies will rely on over the next two years.\nMany of Boehner\u2019s conservative party members are telling him to stick to the original bill. This version includes measures designed to create new areas for gas and oil development, both on land and offshore. The Senate version contains a special clause that designates 80% of all fines paid by BP for the 2010 oil spill to the five states around the Gulf most affected. This would help the area recover from the economic devastation that the oil spill caused. It would help create new truck driving jobs in states like Louisiana, where a loss in tourism affected dozens of towns.\nDemocrats from the state are pushing Boehner to pick up the Senate bill instead of the House version. Representative Richmond and Senator Landrieu are asking their Republican counterparts to consider the economy of their state when choosing a bill to support. The Senate transportation bill was supported by both parties when it passed the first round of votes, and was heralded by many trucking companies and industry lobbyists. It ensures that the roadways of America stay in good enough condition that those working in truck driving jobs can perform their daily duties.\nThe Budget Committee Chairman for the House, Paul Ryan, will also announce a GOP-backed budget this week. It is expected that his version contains greater cuts to discretionary spending than the amount proposed by the President and Congress during 2010. He is also aiming to remove the automatic cuts to the defense department that will begin if the current administration can\u2019t develop a deficit reduction plan with Congress.He is receiving the help of Representative McKeon, the Armed Services Committee Chairman. Both are working together to drop the deficit by $1.2 while keeping the Armed Forces properly funded. There is no word on how these cuts could affect truck driving jobs.\nThe Senate is working on a measure passed by the House that will give growing companies greater access to the public capital markets. This would have beneficial effects for only the largest trucking providers. Senator Landrieu and a group of Democrats are asking the Senate to pass an alternative measure that supports small businesses specifically. Entrepreneurs and smaller truck driving companies will be able to raise new capital and increase their focus on exports.

That's created a massive and growing opportunity for Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ:TNDM). While the insulin pump developer has never been profitable, second-quarter 2019 operating results show that's going to change soon.\nThe medical device company reported a 290% surge in global pump shipments in Q2 2019 compared to the year-ago period, which drove a 173% increase in revenue in that span. The business reported an operating loss of just $1.8 million for the quarter. Considering Tandem Diabetes Care expects second-half 2019 revenue to grow 25% from the first-half tally, profitability appears to be on the horizon. Here's what investors need to know about the most recent results.\nThe company's triple-digit growth lives up to its hype. At the end of the first quarter of 2019, Tandem Diabetes Care touted that it shipped nearly 100,000 insulin pumps worldwide in the past four years. It shipped 21,258 in the second quarter alone.\nThat impressive growth has been driven by an obsession with simplifying the user experience of its products. The medical device company has continuously improved its flagship product, the t:slim X2 insulin pump, with both hardware and software upgrades. The increased convenience, including over-the-air software upgrades and continuous glucose monitoring, resulted in half of all new customers in the first half of 2019 being new to pump therapy.\nAs recent operating results clearly demonstrate, Tandem Diabetes Care has certainly benefited from making its insulin pumps among the easiest to use on the market.\nData source: SEC filing. YoY = Year over Year.\nConsider that the business grew gross profit by nearly $57 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, but operating expenses increased by just $40 million in that span. That's an impressive stat and a winning formula for long-term success.\nThe record growth we achieved in the second quarter has continued to exceed our expectations. The acceleration of our sales growth drivers in recent quarters suggests that the longer-term goals we laid out a year ago may be attainable more quickly than originally anticipated, particularly with the strength of our near-term product pipeline, scaling renewal opportunity and expanding international launch.\nIt's worth pointing out that year-over-year comparisons will weaken going forward. That's because Tandem Diabetes Care launched its latest and most advanced t:slim X2 pump in the third quarter of 2018, which set the business on its current growth trajectory. Of course, full-year revenue guidance still represents year-over-year growth of 94% at the midpoint. Investors can't complain about that.\nConsidering the pace of growth and the fact that the business will turn profitable in the second half of 2019, investors with a long-term mindset might find a lot to like about the stock. Shares have gained 86% in the last year, but the business is valued at $3.3 billion. That represents a price-to-sales ratio of nine, relative to the midpoint of full-year 2019 revenue guidance.

When a vector field is discontinuous at some hypersurface, it can become tangent to that surface from one side or the other, and tangency from both sides creates a two-fold singularity. The flow this creates bears a superficial resemblance to so-called {\\it folded singularities} in (smooth) slow-fast systems, which arise at the intersection of attractive and repelling branches of slow invariant manifolds, important in the local study of canards and mixed mode oscillations. Here we show that these two singularities are intimately related. When the discontinuity in a piecewise smooth system is blown up or smoothed out at a two-fold singularity, the resulting system can be mapped onto a folded singularity. The result is not obvious, however, since it requires the presence of nonlinear or `hidden' terms at the discontinuity, which turn out to be necessary for structural stability of the blow up (or smoothing), and necessary for mapping to the folded singularity.\n\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nFor a local singularity that is so easy to define, the 'two-fold' singularity of piecewise-smooth dynamical systems has proven surprisingly difficult to characterize. It has been the subject of interest both for its intricate phase portrait [3,8], its ambiguous stability [10,11], and recently because of its role in determinacy-breaking [2]. Now that it seems these are all well understood, our interest in this paper is in how the local dynamics relates to that of smooth flows.\nIf a discontinuity occurs in the vector field of a flow on some hypersurface \u03a3, and the flow curves (or 'folds' parabolically) towards or away from \u03a3 on both sides of the surface, then under generic conditions the result is a two-fold singularity, as depicted in figure 1.\nStarting with [8,11], the elucidation of the two-fold singularity's dynamics can be traced through references in [3] (where the local form of the two-fold singularity is also extended to more than three dimensions). Though it can create limit cycles via a local bifurcation [2], the two-fold singularity itself is not an attractor. The main interest therefore lies in its transitory effects on a flow, (i) (  particularly in cases where it forms a bridge from an attracting region on the discontinuity surface into a repelling region, mimicking canard behaviour of smooth two-timescale systems [1] but with a more extreme character, because the two-fold breaks determinacy in both forward and backward time through the singularity. This is illustrated in figure 1 by a typical single trajectory entering the singularity, being deterministic until it does so, and afterwards exploding into a set-valued flow of infinite onward trajectories whose local form, however, is still somewhat constrained by the local geometry.\nParticularly because of some similarity to canard dynamics, attention has turned to how the twofold can be understood as a limit or approximation of a smooth flow. The topological equivalence between \"sliding\" motion along a discontinuity surface, and \"slow\" motion on invariant manifolds of smooth two-timescale systems, has been shown [13]. A qualitative connection has also been made between the sliding phase portraits at two-fold singularities and the slow manifold dynamics at so-called 'folded' singularities of two-timescale systems [4,5]. We shall prove here a more direct connection between the two singularities, by showing equivalence under explicit coordinate transformations.\nThe two singularities that concern us can be defined as isolated points in n \u2265 3 dimensions satisfying the following systems of equations: The two-fold singularity: The folded singularity: system : for j = 2, ..., n parameter : along with a number of non-degeneracy conditions, which state that immediate higher derivatives have typical (i.e. non-vanishing) values; these will be elaborated on later. The functions f i and g i are assumed to be differentiable with respect to their arguments. The parameter \u03bb introduces a discontinuity via the sign function, while \u03b5 introduces a separation into slow and fast timescales t and t/\u03b5 (where\u017c of course denotes the time derivative d dt z). Three dimensions are sufficient to understand the basic dynamics of either singularity, so henceforth we restrict to n = 3.\nIn an attempt to relate the two systems in (1), we might first observe that the folded singularity system becomes discontinuous in the singular \u03b5 \u2192 0 limit. However, that limit is not equivalent to the discontinuous system of the two-fold singularity in (1). To understand how the two systems in (1) are related we must instead start with the two-fold system, and somehow regularize the discontinuity to understand what forms of smooth system have it as a limit.\nRegularizing or smoothing a discontinuity raises immediate issues of uniqueness, namely that infinitely many qualitatively different smooth systems can have the same discontinuous limit. We shall find that actually this ambiguity can be encoded into the discontinuous system by means of nonlinear switching terms -nonlinear dependence on the parameter \u03bb in (1) -as introduced in [9] (sometimes called 'hidden' terms because they vanish everywhere except at the discontinuity).\nWe shall see that the smooth system obtained from a two-fold singularity is structurally unstable if it depends only linearly on \u03bb, and we shall show that a small perturbation, by terms that are nonlinear in \u03bb, restores structural stability and allows transformation into the general local singularity expected in a smooth system, namely the folded singularity.\nIn section II we introduce the normal form of the two-fold singularity, and outline the basic steps for its study by blowing up the discontinuity in section III. In section IV we blow up the normal piecewise smooth system, assuming only linear dependence on \u03bb as in the standard literature, giving a system which we find is structurally unstable. In section V we introduce a nonlinear perturbation of the normal form, then blow this up to find that it removes the structurally instability, and can be mapped onto the folded singularity of a smooth two timescale system. Remarks showing that these results follow also if we smooth, rather than blow up, the discontinuity, are given in section VI.\n\nII. THE TWO-FOLD SINGULARITY\nThe normal form of the two-fold singularity is in terms of constants a i = \u00b11 and b i \u2208 R. By results in [3,8,12], a system is locally approximated by (2) when it satisfies the conditions in the lefthand column of (1), along with non-degeneracy conditions stating that the flow curvature is quadratic, given by lim The local flow 'folds' towards or away from the switching surface x 1 = 0, along the line x 2 = x 1 = 0 on one side of the surface, and along the line x 3 = x 1 = 0 on the other. Hence the point where these lines cross is called the 'two-fold'. As a result, the surface x 1 = 0 is attractive in x 2 , x 3 > 0 and repulsive in x 2 , x 3 < 0, while trajectories cross the surface transversely in x 2 x 3 < 0.\nIn the attractive and repulsive regions the flow slides along the surface x 1 = 0, and the vector field it follows is found by interpolating across the discontinuity; we shall see how this is done below.\nThe qualitative picture is then as shown in figure 1. The precise form of the local dynamics depends on whether the flow curves towards or away from the discontinuity, determined by a 1 and a 2 , and also depends crucially on the quantity b 1 b 2 , which quantifies the jump in the angle of the flow across the discontinuity. An accounting of the many classes of dynamics that arise from these simple conditions is given in [3] and references therein, we give only the pertinent details here.\nThe three main 'flavours' of two-fold are: the visible two-fold for a 1 = a 2 = \u22121, the invisible two-fold for a 1 = a 2 = 1, and the mixed two-fold for a 1 a 2 = \u22121; an example of each is shown in figure 1 (i,ii,iii) respectively. In the cases depicted, there exist one or more trajectories passing from the attractive sliding region to the repelling sliding region, called canard orbits. This passage occurs in finite time (since the vector field (2) is non-vanishing everywhere locally). The flow is unique in forward time everywhere except in the repelling sliding region, where it is set-valued because trajectories may slide along x 1 = 0, but also be ejected into x 1 > 0 or x 1 < 0 at any point.\nThis means that the flow may evolve deterministically until it arrives at the singularity by means of a canard, at which point it becomes set-valued, so we say that determinacy breaking occurs at the singularity whenever canards are exhibited. This occurs in the invisible case when b 1 , b 2 < 0 and b 1 b 2 > 1, in the visible case when b 1 < 0 or b 2 < 0 or b 1 b 2 < 1, and finally in the mixed case We shall henceforth be concerned only with the dynamics that has previously been missing, that which occurs inside the discontinuity itself and gives rise to determinacy-breaking at the singularity.\nIn any event, the first step in studying the local dynamics must be to extend the system (2) in such a way that is can be solved across the discontinuity x 1 = 0, as follows.\n\nIII. BLOW UP\nWe shall outline the procedure for studying (2) in a general form first. Let x = (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) and , and begin with a piecewise-smooth syste\u1e41 which can be extended to x 1 = 0 by defining f as The function g is smooth, and provides f with a nonlinear dependence on \u03bb. Without g the function f (x; \u03bb) is the convex combination as used in Filippov's standard approach to switching [8], and here we shall introduce g = 0 only as a small perturbation when necessary.\nThe dynamics outside the discontinuity (x 1 = 0) is now given by taking either of \u03bb = \u00b11 in (4), which reproduces (3). On the discontinuity (x 1 = 0) we consider whether there exists \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1] such that\u1e8b 1 = 0, for which the flow of (4) lies in the tangent plane of the discontinuity, in which case sliding dynamics along the discontinuity surface is possible. The sliding dynamics can be reached in finite forward or backward time, meaning the flow can lose or gain a dimension as it arrives at or departs from x 1 = 0, so the resulting flow might not be unique. Therefore we shall follow [9] and regain uniqueness by blowing up the discontinuity manifold x 1 = 0, to study the dynamics of \u03bb that transports the flow through the jump between \u22121 and +1. This is done as follows.\nBecause \u03bb is a function of x 1 only, the dynamics of \u03bb is induced by the x 1 component of the where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to some dummy timescale, instantaneous compared to the main timescale. One way to describe this is to say \u03bb \u2032 \u2261 \u03b5 d\u03bb dt for infinitesimal \u03b5 > 0. (In fact, this blow up is equivalent to defining \u03bb as a function we discuss this further in section VI). We obtain for the blow up system on x 1 = 0, The steady states of the 'fast' prime system satisfy a differential-algebraic system which defines dynamics on an invariant manifold The system (7)  The systems (4) and (6) are sufficient to specify the local dynamics, and we shall now apply these to the normal form. The final step in our analysis will be to transform the system (6) into the normal form of a folded singularity, but we shall find that this is only possible if g is nonzero, and hence there is a nonlinear dependence on \u03bb.\n\nIV. THE UNPERTURBED SYSTEM\nIn this section we show the following.\nProposition 1. The blow-up (6) of the normal form two-fold singularity (2) with g \u2261 0 is structurally unstable.\nTo prove this we will perform the blow up described in section I, and show that the sliding manifold M S exhibits a degeneracy.\nTo resolve the dynamics across the discontinuity, we use (4) to express the system (2) as a convex combination : Using the blow-up (6) on x 1 = 0 we obtain the two timescale system with \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1]. The fast system on \u03bb \u2032 has equilibria where \u03bb \u2032 = 0, yielding a differential- This describes states that evolve inside the switching surface x 1 = 0 on the main timescale, and these are precisely Filippov's sliding modes. We can solve in the sliding mode to get \u03bb = (x 3 \u2212 x 2 )/(x 3 + x 2 ), and sliding modes exist only when this lies in the allowed range \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1], hence In the absence of sliding modes, where x 2 x 3 < 0, equation (9) describes the instantaneous transition from one boundary of \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1] to another, whereby the flow crosses through the switching surface as \u03bb flips sign.\nConcerning the sliding regions x 2 x 3 > 0 on x 1 = 0, the subsystem (10) inhabits invariant manifolds of the blow-up system (9) given by We call M S the sliding manifold. It consists of two normally hyperbolic branches, one attractive in x 2 , x 3 > 0 since \u2202\u03bb \u2032 /\u2202\u03bb = \u2212(x 3 + x 2 )/2 < 0, and one repulsive in x 2 , x 3 < 0 since \u2202\u03bb \u2032 /\u2202\u03bb = \u2212(x 3 + x 2 )/2 > 0. The two branches are connected at x 2 = x 3 = 0, along a line Along L we have \u2202\u03bb \u2032 /\u2202\u03bb = 0, so the manifold M S is no longer normally hyperbolic where it meets L, and therefore is not invariant there. Figure 2 shows an example of the discontinuous system (i), and its blow-up (ii) showing M S and L, rotated in (iii) to show L more clearly. The dynamics in the manifold is best viewed along the u 3 axis of rotated coordinates The line L represents the two-fold singularity (x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = 0), stretched out over the interval \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1] in the blow up. Comparing the alignment of L with the dynamics outside M S , however, reveals a degeneracy in the system (9). The non-hyperbolic set L is a line with tangent vector e L = (1, 0, 0) in the space of (\u03bb, x 2 , x 3 ), which means it lies everywhere parallel to the fast one-dimensional \u03bb \u2032 system in (9). As a result, all along L we have not only \u2202f 1 /\u2202\u03bb = 0, but also \u2202 2 f 1 /\u2202\u03bb 2 = 0 and moreover \u2202 r f 1 /\u2202\u03bb r = 0 for all r > 1. This constitutes an infinite codimension degeneracy, so the system is structurally unstable. This is the result in the proposition.\n\nRemarks on the degeneracy\nThe degeneracy means that the flow is not transverse to the set L where the two sheets of M S intersect. As a result, if we perturb the system, transversal intersection between the attracting and repelling branches of the invariant manifold M S cannot be guaranteed, see e.g. [14]. Small changes in the expression (8)  In the literature on smooth two timescale systems (as we have here in (\u03bb, x 2 , x 3 ) space), the connection of attracting and repelling branches of a slow invariant manifold has been well studied, leading to a generic canonical form and requisite non-degeneracy conditions as described in [14].\nIn our notation those conditions are the existence of a point on L where the fourth of which is violated everywhere in the system described above.\nAdding constant terms or powers of x 2 and x 3 to (8) would only move the set L in the (x 2 , x 3 ) plane, not remove its degeneracy, and terms depending on x 1 would vanish at the discontinuity.\nThe only recourse to break the degeneracy, particularly to give \u2202 2 f 1 \u2202\u03bb 2 = 0, is therefore to add terms nonlinear in \u03bb. Anything we add to the function f 1 in (8) must still give (2), so it must vanish outside the switching surface x 1 = 0, i.e. be a perturbation of the form (4), as we introduce in the next section.\n\nV. THE PERTURBED SYSTEM\nIn this section we show the following.\nProposition 2. The blow-up (6) of the normal form two-fold singularity (2) with g = (\u03b1, 0, 0) can be transformed into provided \u03b1 = 0 for small \u03b5 > 0, where a, b, c, are real constants, and provided the conditions It turns out that the case excluded by the conditions \u00b1 1 2 (b 1 \u2212 b 2 ) \u2264 1 = \u00b1a 1 = \u2213a 2 is that in which there are no canards or faux-canards, i.e. no orbits of the sliding flow passing through the singularity.\nOn x 1 = 0 we consider the blow up of (14) as before, now giving This is an \u03b1-perturbation of (9). The \u03bb \u2032 system has equilibria on the set The surface described by M S forms an invariant manifold of (15) at all points where it is normally hyperbolic, i.e. where \u2202\u03bb \u2032 \u2202\u03bb = 0, which now holds except on the curve The curve L has tangent vector e L = (1 , +2\u03b1(\u03bb \u2212 1) , \u22122\u03b1(\u03bb + 1)), which for all |\u03bb| \u2264 1 is transverse to the flow if \u03b1 = 0. In particular L is now transverse to the dot and prime timescale subsystems in (15), so the degeneracy of the unperturbed system has been broken. We show below that this perturbed \u03b1 = 0 system is structurally stable by mapping the two timescale blow-up system (15) Denoting the value of f i at the singularity as f is , and solving (18) via we find that the folded singularity lies at (\u03bb, x 2 , x 3 ) = (\u03bb s , x 2s , x 3s ) where Noting that a 1 and a 2 just takes values \u00b11, we have: , so there exists a unique \u03bb s \u2208 [\u22121, +1] for any b 1 and b 2 (the positive root for b 1 > b 2 , the negative root for b 1 < b 2 ); , so there exists a unique \u03bb s \u2208 [\u22121, +1] for any b 1 and b 2 (the positive root for b 1 < b 2 , the negative root for b 1 > b 2 ); , there exist two points with \u03bb s \u2208 [\u22121, +1] for b 1 \u2212 b 2 > 2, and no points otherwise.\nand no points otherwise.\nIn the cases where \u03bb s is unique we proceed directly to the steps that follow below. In the cases where \u03bb s can take two values we can proceed with the following analysis about each value, and will obtain different constants in the final local expression, i.e. a different folded singularity corresponding to each \u03bb s . In the cases when \u03bb s does not exist, no equivalence can be formed; these are the cases when the the two-fold's sliding portrait is of focal type (see [3]) where orbits winds around the two-fold but sliding orbits never enter or leave it. So excluding those cases a 1 = \u2212a 2 = 1 with we can proceed as follows.\nIt is more useful to parameterize L in terms of y 3 , which we obtain as L : in terms of three functions y 1L , y 2L , y 3L , whose derivatives are Since x \u2032 \u2261 \u03b5\u1e8b this is the result in the proposition, and it is clearly valid only for \u03b1 = 0. Figure 5 shows an example of the perturbed system and its blow up for each flavour of two-fold in (i) (corresponding to those in figure 1), followed by their blow up (ii), and a rotation (iii) to show the phase portrait around the set L more clearly (similar to figure 2). In the most extreme case, the folded node, the original phase portrait contains infinitely many intersecting trajectories traversing the singularity, while the perturbed system splits these into distinguishable orbits, a finite number of which asymptote to the attracting and repelling branches of the critical manifold.\n\nRemarks on the singularity\nA glance at the papers [6,14,15] reveals what a charismatic singularity lies hidden in the dynamics of the two-fold, revealed by blow-up, and waiting to be released when the discontinuous system is perturbed by simulations that smooth, regularize, or otherwise approximate the discontinuity.\nIn particular one may ask what happens in the cases of determinacy-breaking illustrated in figure 1, since a smooth flow should be deterministic. Because the two-fold maps to a folded singularity (actually one or two folded singularities as we saw above), if we consider what happens with \u03b5 > 0 we find determinacy is restored, but replaced by sensitivity to initial conditions.\nThe manifold M S becomes the slow critical manifold of a slow-fast system, and for \u03b5 by standard results of geometric singular perturbation theory [7], there exist invariant manifolds M S \u03b5 in the \u03b5-neighbourhood of M S but away from L, on which the dynamics is topologically equivalent to the sliding dynamics (termed 'reduced' or slow dynamics usually in this context) found above.\nTrajectories that pass close to the singularity, or more precisely, close to the folded singularity on the set L, may persist in following the manifold M S from its stable to unstable branches, while other nearby trajectories will veer wildly away, their fate sensitive to initial conditions and proximity to primary canard orbits (those which persist along both branches of M S throughout the local region).\nLike the different kinds of two-fold, there are different classes of folded singularity, and their classification depends on the slow dynamics inside M S . From the expressions (29)-(30) we see that the class therefore depends not only on the constants a 1 , a 2 , b 1 , b 2 , of the original piecewise smooth system, but also on the 'hidden' parameter \u03b1. The classification scheme is fairly simple, and can be used to verify the dynamics on M S seen in figure 3. The projection of the system (29) onto M S , found by differentiating the condition 0 =x 2 +x 2 1 with respect to time to give 0 =bx 3 +cx A classification then follows by neglecting the singular prefactor 1/2x 1 and considering whether the phase portrait is that of a focus, a node, or a saddle. This is determined by the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix Jacobian, which has tracec, determinant 2\u00e3b, and eigenvalues 1 2 (c \u00b1 c 2 \u2212 8\u00e3b). This will not be the true system's phase portrait because the time-scaling from the 1/2x 1 factor is positive in the attractive branch of M S , negative (time-reversing) in the repulsive branch, and divergent at the singularity (turning infinite time convergence to the singularity into finite time passage through the singularity). The effect of this is to 'fold' together attracting and repelling pairs of each equilibrium type, so each equilibrium becomes a 'folded-equilibrium', forming a continuous bridge between branches of M S . As a result the flow on M S is a folded-saddle if\u00e3b < 0, a folded-node if 0 < 8\u00e3b <c 2 , and a folded-focus ifc 2 < 8\u00e3b. Canard cases occur forc > 0 and faux canard for c < 0. In figure 3 we show the result of blowing up the discontinuous system for an example of each type of two-fold that exhibits determinacy-breaking (those from figure 1). In the visible two-fold the singularity becomes a folded-saddle, in the invisible case it becomes a folded-node, while the mixed case becomes a pair consisting of one folded-saddle and one folded-node.\nOne may ask why certain cases, in particular those without determinacy-breaking, were excluded by the proposition above. These are systems where the sliding phase portraits contain no orbits passing between the attracting and repelling sliding regions, and therefore one expects that in their blow up there should exists no canards connecting attracting and repelling branches of M S , and hence no folded singularities. If there are no such connections then no intersections between the two branches of M S persist when we let \u03b5 be nonzero. Hence the omission of these cases is consistent, and a posteori it is obviously necessary.\nIn figure 4 we illustrate the way splitting of manifolds occurs when we introduce the instantaneous timescale (whose derivative is denoted with a prime) with a fast timescale t/\u03b5 for \u03b5 > 0. The case shown is an invisible two-fold.  An in-depth description of the dynamics that ensues in the different cases of two-folds, and the smoothings subject to perturbations, would be lengthy, and deserves future study elsewhere.\nAs a demonstration we conclude with three examples of complex oscillatory attractors formed by two-fold singularities, simulated by smoothing. We take \u03b1 = 1/5 and: function \u03bb 1 = sign x 1 is replaced with a sigmoid function tanh(x 1 /\u03b5) with \u03b5 = 10 \u22125 . Because the system is structurally stable, the exact choice of smoothing function is not important so long as it is simple, for example continuous and monotonic, and further simulations not shown here verify that such dynamics persists with different smoothing functions, for example varying \u03b5, or replacing x 1 with a different sigmoid function such as x 1 / \u03b5 2 + x 2 1 . The first row shows the simulation of a single trajectory for a time interval t = 1000 in (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) space, as the flow attempts to switch between the critical slow manifold flow in (ii) given by the blow up on x 1 = 0, and the x 1 > 0 and x 1 < 0 flows in (i). In the second row we plot the familiar picture of sliding dynamics on x 1 = 0 for the unperturbed system (neglecting nonlinear \u03bb), and sketch the curvature of the x 1 = 0 flows.\nThe sliding vector field has canard trajectories passing from the righthand attracting branch to the lefthand repelling branch via the folded singularity; at a visible two-fold only one canard exists, at an invisible two-fold every sliding trajectory is a canard, and at a mixed two-fold a region of trajectories are canards. The third row shows the critical manifold M S in the (\u03bb 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) blow up.\n\nVI. CLOSING REMARKS\nFor such a simple system, even taking its piecewise linear local normal form, the two-fold exhibits intricate and varied dynamics. Just how intricate becomes even more clear as we attempt to regularize the discontinuity, and study how the two-fold related to slow-fast dynamics of smooth systems. As well as insight into the dynamics that is seen upon simulated such a system, this adds a new facet to the question of the structural stability of the two-fold, which has remained a stimulating question since [11].\nThe degeneracy in section IV gives some insight into why simulations of systems containing twofold singularities with determinacy-breaking singularities are highly unpredictable. In attempting to solve near a discontinuity, simulations may introduce aspects of smoothing, hysteresis, delay and noise, not represented in the ideal discontinuous model, with unpredictable effects on such a structurally unstable high codimension degeneracy. We therefore have to resolve this degeneracy before expecting to obtain comprehensible simulations, and without leaving the class of piecewise smooth systems, the nonlinear switching term introduced in the perturbed system in section V is sufficient.\nThe system (14) now succeeds (8) as our prototype for the local dynamics of the two-fold singularity (with \u03bb given by (5) in both cases). The question of whether this constitutes a 'normal form' has issues both in the discontinuous and slow-fast settings, but it is clear that (14) is structurally stable, and represents all classes of behaviour that occur both in the discontinuous system, and in its blow up to a slow-fast system.\nFinally we should emphasize that the results of this paper are equivalent if we smooth, rather than blow up, the discontinuity. In particular the degeneracy that makes the perturbation g = 0 necessary is still present. To relate the procedure of smoothing (or Sotomayor-Teixeira's regularization [13]) to the blow up procedure, we consider \u03bb as a function rather than a dynamic variable.", "prompt": "Fold singularities of nonsmooth and slow-fast dynamical systems -- equivalence by the hidden dynamics approach\n\nThe {\\it two-fold singularity} has played a significant role in our understanding of uniqueness and stability in piecewise smooth dynamical systems. When a vector field is discontinuous at some hypersurface, it can become tangent to that surface from one side or the other, and tangency from both sides creates a two-fold singularity. The flow this creates bears a superficial resemblance to so-called {\\it folded singularities} in (smooth) slow-fast systems, which arise at the intersection of attractive and repelling branches of slow invariant manifolds, important in the local study of canards and mixed mode oscillations. Here we show that these two singularities are intimately related. When the discontinuity in a piecewise smooth system is blown up or smoothed out at a two-fold singularity, the resulting system can be mapped onto a folded singularity. The result is not obvious, however, since it requires the presence of nonlinear or `hidden' terms at the discontinuity, which turn out to be necessary for structural stability of the blow up (or smoothing), and necessary for mapping to the folded singularity.\n\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nFor a local singularity that is so easy to define, the 'two-fold' singularity of piecewise-smooth dynamical systems has proven surprisingly difficult to characterize. It has been the subject of interest both for its intricate phase portrait [3,8], its ambiguous stability [10,11], and recently because of its role in determinacy-breaking [2]. Now that it seems these are all well understood, our interest in this paper is in how the local dynamics relates to that of smooth flows.\nIf a discontinuity occurs in the vector field of a flow on some hypersurface \u03a3, and the flow curves (or 'folds' parabolically) towards or away from \u03a3 on both sides of the surface, then under generic conditions the result is a two-fold singularity, as depicted in figure 1.\nStarting with [8,11], the elucidation of the two-fold singularity's dynamics can be traced through references in [3] (where the local form of the two-fold singularity is also extended to more than three dimensions). Though it can create limit cycles via a local bifurcation [2], the two-fold singularity itself is not an attractor. The main interest therefore lies in its transitory effects on a flow, (i) (  particularly in cases where it forms a bridge from an attracting region on the discontinuity surface into a repelling region, mimicking canard behaviour of smooth two-timescale systems [1] but with a more extreme character, because the two-fold breaks determinacy in both forward and backward time through the singularity. This is illustrated in figure 1 by a typical single trajectory entering the singularity, being deterministic until it does so, and afterwards exploding into a set-valued flow of infinite onward trajectories whose local form, however, is still somewhat constrained by the local geometry.\nParticularly because of some similarity to canard dynamics, attention has turned to how the twofold can be understood as a limit or approximation of a smooth flow. The topological equivalence between \"sliding\" motion along a discontinuity surface, and \"slow\" motion on invariant manifolds of smooth two-timescale systems, has been shown [13]. A qualitative connection has also been made between the sliding phase portraits at two-fold singularities and the slow manifold dynamics at so-called 'folded' singularities of two-timescale systems [4,5]. We shall prove here a more direct connection between the two singularities, by showing equivalence under explicit coordinate transformations.\nThe two singularities that concern us can be defined as isolated points in n \u2265 3 dimensions satisfying the following systems of equations: The two-fold singularity: The folded singularity: system : for j = 2, ..., n parameter : along with a number of non-degeneracy conditions, which state that immediate higher derivatives have typical (i.e. non-vanishing) values; these will be elaborated on later. The functions f i and g i are assumed to be differentiable with respect to their arguments. The parameter \u03bb introduces a discontinuity via the sign function, while \u03b5 introduces a separation into slow and fast timescales t and t/\u03b5 (where\u017c of course denotes the time derivative d dt z). Three dimensions are sufficient to understand the basic dynamics of either singularity, so henceforth we restrict to n = 3.\nIn an attempt to relate the two systems in (1), we might first observe that the folded singularity system becomes discontinuous in the singular \u03b5 \u2192 0 limit. However, that limit is not equivalent to the discontinuous system of the two-fold singularity in (1). To understand how the two systems in (1) are related we must instead start with the two-fold system, and somehow regularize the discontinuity to understand what forms of smooth system have it as a limit.\nRegularizing or smoothing a discontinuity raises immediate issues of uniqueness, namely that infinitely many qualitatively different smooth systems can have the same discontinuous limit. We shall find that actually this ambiguity can be encoded into the discontinuous system by means of nonlinear switching terms -nonlinear dependence on the parameter \u03bb in (1) -as introduced in [9] (sometimes called 'hidden' terms because they vanish everywhere except at the discontinuity).\nWe shall see that the smooth system obtained from a two-fold singularity is structurally unstable if it depends only linearly on \u03bb, and we shall show that a small perturbation, by terms that are nonlinear in \u03bb, restores structural stability and allows transformation into the general local singularity expected in a smooth system, namely the folded singularity.\nIn section II we introduce the normal form of the two-fold singularity, and outline the basic steps for its study by blowing up the discontinuity in section III. In section IV we blow up the normal piecewise smooth system, assuming only linear dependence on \u03bb as in the standard literature, giving a system which we find is structurally unstable. In section V we introduce a nonlinear perturbation of the normal form, then blow this up to find that it removes the structurally instability, and can be mapped onto the folded singularity of a smooth two timescale system. Remarks showing that these results follow also if we smooth, rather than blow up, the discontinuity, are given in section VI.\n\nII. THE TWO-FOLD SINGULARITY\nThe normal form of the two-fold singularity is in terms of constants a i = \u00b11 and b i \u2208 R. By results in [3,8,12], a system is locally approximated by (2) when it satisfies the conditions in the lefthand column of (1), along with non-degeneracy conditions stating that the flow curvature is quadratic, given by lim The local flow 'folds' towards or away from the switching surface x 1 = 0, along the line x 2 = x 1 = 0 on one side of the surface, and along the line x 3 = x 1 = 0 on the other. Hence the point where these lines cross is called the 'two-fold'. As a result, the surface x 1 = 0 is attractive in x 2 , x 3 > 0 and repulsive in x 2 , x 3 < 0, while trajectories cross the surface transversely in x 2 x 3 < 0.\nIn the attractive and repulsive regions the flow slides along the surface x 1 = 0, and the vector field it follows is found by interpolating across the discontinuity; we shall see how this is done below.\nThe qualitative picture is then as shown in figure 1. The precise form of the local dynamics depends on whether the flow curves towards or away from the discontinuity, determined by a 1 and a 2 , and also depends crucially on the quantity b 1 b 2 , which quantifies the jump in the angle of the flow across the discontinuity. An accounting of the many classes of dynamics that arise from these simple conditions is given in [3] and references therein, we give only the pertinent details here.\nThe three main 'flavours' of two-fold are: the visible two-fold for a 1 = a 2 = \u22121, the invisible two-fold for a 1 = a 2 = 1, and the mixed two-fold for a 1 a 2 = \u22121; an example of each is shown in figure 1 (i,ii,iii) respectively. In the cases depicted, there exist one or more trajectories passing from the attractive sliding region to the repelling sliding region, called canard orbits. This passage occurs in finite time (since the vector field (2) is non-vanishing everywhere locally). The flow is unique in forward time everywhere except in the repelling sliding region, where it is set-valued because trajectories may slide along x 1 = 0, but also be ejected into x 1 > 0 or x 1 < 0 at any point.\nThis means that the flow may evolve deterministically until it arrives at the singularity by means of a canard, at which point it becomes set-valued, so we say that determinacy breaking occurs at the singularity whenever canards are exhibited. This occurs in the invisible case when b 1 , b 2 < 0 and b 1 b 2 > 1, in the visible case when b 1 < 0 or b 2 < 0 or b 1 b 2 < 1, and finally in the mixed case We shall henceforth be concerned only with the dynamics that has previously been missing, that which occurs inside the discontinuity itself and gives rise to determinacy-breaking at the singularity.\nIn any event, the first step in studying the local dynamics must be to extend the system (2) in such a way that is can be solved across the discontinuity x 1 = 0, as follows.\n\nIII. BLOW UP\nWe shall outline the procedure for studying (2) in a general form first. Let x = (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) and , and begin with a piecewise-smooth syste\u1e41 which can be extended to x 1 = 0 by defining f as The function g is smooth, and provides f with a nonlinear dependence on \u03bb. Without g the function f (x; \u03bb) is the convex combination as used in Filippov's standard approach to switching [8], and here we shall introduce g = 0 only as a small perturbation when necessary.\nThe dynamics outside the discontinuity (x 1 = 0) is now given by taking either of \u03bb = \u00b11 in (4), which reproduces (3). On the discontinuity (x 1 = 0) we consider whether there exists \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1] such that\u1e8b 1 = 0, for which the flow of (4) lies in the tangent plane of the discontinuity, in which case sliding dynamics along the discontinuity surface is possible. The sliding dynamics can be reached in finite forward or backward time, meaning the flow can lose or gain a dimension as it arrives at or departs from x 1 = 0, so the resulting flow might not be unique. Therefore we shall follow [9] and regain uniqueness by blowing up the discontinuity manifold x 1 = 0, to study the dynamics of \u03bb that transports the flow through the jump between \u22121 and +1. This is done as follows.\nBecause \u03bb is a function of x 1 only, the dynamics of \u03bb is induced by the x 1 component of the where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to some dummy timescale, instantaneous compared to the main timescale. One way to describe this is to say \u03bb \u2032 \u2261 \u03b5 d\u03bb dt for infinitesimal \u03b5 > 0. (In fact, this blow up is equivalent to defining \u03bb as a function we discuss this further in section VI). We obtain for the blow up system on x 1 = 0, The steady states of the 'fast' prime system satisfy a differential-algebraic system which defines dynamics on an invariant manifold The system (7)  The systems (4) and (6) are sufficient to specify the local dynamics, and we shall now apply these to the normal form. The final step in our analysis will be to transform the system (6) into the normal form of a folded singularity, but we shall find that this is only possible if g is nonzero, and hence there is a nonlinear dependence on \u03bb.\n\nIV. THE UNPERTURBED SYSTEM\nIn this section we show the following.\nProposition 1. The blow-up (6) of the normal form two-fold singularity (2) with g \u2261 0 is structurally unstable.\nTo prove this we will perform the blow up described in section I, and show that the sliding manifold M S exhibits a degeneracy.\nTo resolve the dynamics across the discontinuity, we use (4) to express the system (2) as a convex combination : Using the blow-up (6) on x 1 = 0 we obtain the two timescale system with \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1]. The fast system on \u03bb \u2032 has equilibria where \u03bb \u2032 = 0, yielding a differential- This describes states that evolve inside the switching surface x 1 = 0 on the main timescale, and these are precisely Filippov's sliding modes. We can solve in the sliding mode to get \u03bb = (x 3 \u2212 x 2 )/(x 3 + x 2 ), and sliding modes exist only when this lies in the allowed range \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1], hence In the absence of sliding modes, where x 2 x 3 < 0, equation (9) describes the instantaneous transition from one boundary of \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1] to another, whereby the flow crosses through the switching surface as \u03bb flips sign.\nConcerning the sliding regions x 2 x 3 > 0 on x 1 = 0, the subsystem (10) inhabits invariant manifolds of the blow-up system (9) given by We call M S the sliding manifold. It consists of two normally hyperbolic branches, one attractive in x 2 , x 3 > 0 since \u2202\u03bb \u2032 /\u2202\u03bb = \u2212(x 3 + x 2 )/2 < 0, and one repulsive in x 2 , x 3 < 0 since \u2202\u03bb \u2032 /\u2202\u03bb = \u2212(x 3 + x 2 )/2 > 0. The two branches are connected at x 2 = x 3 = 0, along a line Along L we have \u2202\u03bb \u2032 /\u2202\u03bb = 0, so the manifold M S is no longer normally hyperbolic where it meets L, and therefore is not invariant there. Figure 2 shows an example of the discontinuous system (i), and its blow-up (ii) showing M S and L, rotated in (iii) to show L more clearly. The dynamics in the manifold is best viewed along the u 3 axis of rotated coordinates The line L represents the two-fold singularity (x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = 0), stretched out over the interval \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1] in the blow up. Comparing the alignment of L with the dynamics outside M S , however, reveals a degeneracy in the system (9). The non-hyperbolic set L is a line with tangent vector e L = (1, 0, 0) in the space of (\u03bb, x 2 , x 3 ), which means it lies everywhere parallel to the fast one-dimensional \u03bb \u2032 system in (9). As a result, all along L we have not only \u2202f 1 /\u2202\u03bb = 0, but also \u2202 2 f 1 /\u2202\u03bb 2 = 0 and moreover \u2202 r f 1 /\u2202\u03bb r = 0 for all r > 1. This constitutes an infinite codimension degeneracy, so the system is structurally unstable. This is the result in the proposition.\n\nRemarks on the degeneracy\nThe degeneracy means that the flow is not transverse to the set L where the two sheets of M S intersect. As a result, if we perturb the system, transversal intersection between the attracting and repelling branches of the invariant manifold M S cannot be guaranteed, see e.g. [14]. Small changes in the expression (8)  In the literature on smooth two timescale systems (as we have here in (\u03bb, x 2 , x 3 ) space), the connection of attracting and repelling branches of a slow invariant manifold has been well studied, leading to a generic canonical form and requisite non-degeneracy conditions as described in [14].\nIn our notation those conditions are the existence of a point on L where the fourth of which is violated everywhere in the system described above.\nAdding constant terms or powers of x 2 and x 3 to (8) would only move the set L in the (x 2 , x 3 ) plane, not remove its degeneracy, and terms depending on x 1 would vanish at the discontinuity.\nThe only recourse to break the degeneracy, particularly to give \u2202 2 f 1 \u2202\u03bb 2 = 0, is therefore to add terms nonlinear in \u03bb. Anything we add to the function f 1 in (8) must still give (2), so it must vanish outside the switching surface x 1 = 0, i.e. be a perturbation of the form (4), as we introduce in the next section.\n\nV. THE PERTURBED SYSTEM\nIn this section we show the following.\nProposition 2. The blow-up (6) of the normal form two-fold singularity (2) with g = (\u03b1, 0, 0) can be transformed into provided \u03b1 = 0 for small \u03b5 > 0, where a, b, c, are real constants, and provided the conditions It turns out that the case excluded by the conditions \u00b1 1 2 (b 1 \u2212 b 2 ) \u2264 1 = \u00b1a 1 = \u2213a 2 is that in which there are no canards or faux-canards, i.e. no orbits of the sliding flow passing through the singularity.\nOn x 1 = 0 we consider the blow up of (14) as before, now giving This is an \u03b1-perturbation of (9). The \u03bb \u2032 system has equilibria on the set The surface described by M S forms an invariant manifold of (15) at all points where it is normally hyperbolic, i.e. where \u2202\u03bb \u2032 \u2202\u03bb = 0, which now holds except on the curve The curve L has tangent vector e L = (1 , +2\u03b1(\u03bb \u2212 1) , \u22122\u03b1(\u03bb + 1)), which for all |\u03bb| \u2264 1 is transverse to the flow if \u03b1 = 0. In particular L is now transverse to the dot and prime timescale subsystems in (15), so the degeneracy of the unperturbed system has been broken. We show below that this perturbed \u03b1 = 0 system is structurally stable by mapping the two timescale blow-up system (15) Denoting the value of f i at the singularity as f is , and solving (18) via we find that the folded singularity lies at (\u03bb, x 2 , x 3 ) = (\u03bb s , x 2s , x 3s ) where Noting that a 1 and a 2 just takes values \u00b11, we have: , so there exists a unique \u03bb s \u2208 [\u22121, +1] for any b 1 and b 2 (the positive root for b 1 > b 2 , the negative root for b 1 < b 2 ); , so there exists a unique \u03bb s \u2208 [\u22121, +1] for any b 1 and b 2 (the positive root for b 1 < b 2 , the negative root for b 1 > b 2 ); , there exist two points with \u03bb s \u2208 [\u22121, +1] for b 1 \u2212 b 2 > 2, and no points otherwise.\nand no points otherwise.\nIn the cases where \u03bb s is unique we proceed directly to the steps that follow below. In the cases where \u03bb s can take two values we can proceed with the following analysis about each value, and will obtain different constants in the final local expression, i.e. a different folded singularity corresponding to each \u03bb s . In the cases when \u03bb s does not exist, no equivalence can be formed; these are the cases when the the two-fold's sliding portrait is of focal type (see [3]) where orbits winds around the two-fold but sliding orbits never enter or leave it. So excluding those cases a 1 = \u2212a 2 = 1 with we can proceed as follows.\nIt is more useful to parameterize L in terms of y 3 , which we obtain as L : in terms of three functions y 1L , y 2L , y 3L , whose derivatives are Since x \u2032 \u2261 \u03b5\u1e8b this is the result in the proposition, and it is clearly valid only for \u03b1 = 0. Figure 5 shows an example of the perturbed system and its blow up for each flavour of two-fold in (i) (corresponding to those in figure 1), followed by their blow up (ii), and a rotation (iii) to show the phase portrait around the set L more clearly (similar to figure 2). In the most extreme case, the folded node, the original phase portrait contains infinitely many intersecting trajectories traversing the singularity, while the perturbed system splits these into distinguishable orbits, a finite number of which asymptote to the attracting and repelling branches of the critical manifold.\n\nRemarks on the singularity\nA glance at the papers [6,14,15] reveals what a charismatic singularity lies hidden in the dynamics of the two-fold, revealed by blow-up, and waiting to be released when the discontinuous system is perturbed by simulations that smooth, regularize, or otherwise approximate the discontinuity.\nIn particular one may ask what happens in the cases of determinacy-breaking illustrated in figure 1, since a smooth flow should be deterministic. Because the two-fold maps to a folded singularity (actually one or two folded singularities as we saw above), if we consider what happens with \u03b5 > 0 we find determinacy is restored, but replaced by sensitivity to initial conditions.\nThe manifold M S becomes the slow critical manifold of a slow-fast system, and for \u03b5 by standard results of geometric singular perturbation theory [7], there exist invariant manifolds M S \u03b5 in the \u03b5-neighbourhood of M S but away from L, on which the dynamics is topologically equivalent to the sliding dynamics (termed 'reduced' or slow dynamics usually in this context) found above.\nTrajectories that pass close to the singularity, or more precisely, close to the folded singularity on the set L, may persist in following the manifold M S from its stable to unstable branches, while other nearby trajectories will veer wildly away, their fate sensitive to initial conditions and proximity to primary canard orbits (those which persist along both branches of M S throughout the local region).\nLike the different kinds of two-fold, there are different classes of folded singularity, and their classification depends on the slow dynamics inside M S . From the expressions (29)-(30) we see that the class therefore depends not only on the constants a 1 , a 2 , b 1 , b 2 , of the original piecewise smooth system, but also on the 'hidden' parameter \u03b1. The classification scheme is fairly simple, and can be used to verify the dynamics on M S seen in figure 3. The projection of the system (29) onto M S , found by differentiating the condition 0 =x 2 +x 2 1 with respect to time to give 0 =bx 3 +cx A classification then follows by neglecting the singular prefactor 1/2x 1 and considering whether the phase portrait is that of a focus, a node, or a saddle. This is determined by the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix Jacobian, which has tracec, determinant 2\u00e3b, and eigenvalues 1 2 (c \u00b1 c 2 \u2212 8\u00e3b). This will not be the true system's phase portrait because the time-scaling from the 1/2x 1 factor is positive in the attractive branch of M S , negative (time-reversing) in the repulsive branch, and divergent at the singularity (turning infinite time convergence to the singularity into finite time passage through the singularity). The effect of this is to 'fold' together attracting and repelling pairs of each equilibrium type, so each equilibrium becomes a 'folded-equilibrium', forming a continuous bridge between branches of M S . As a result the flow on M S is a folded-saddle if\u00e3b < 0, a folded-node if 0 < 8\u00e3b <c 2 , and a folded-focus ifc 2 < 8\u00e3b. Canard cases occur forc > 0 and faux canard for c < 0. In figure 3 we show the result of blowing up the discontinuous system for an example of each type of two-fold that exhibits determinacy-breaking (those from figure 1). In the visible two-fold the singularity becomes a folded-saddle, in the invisible case it becomes a folded-node, while the mixed case becomes a pair consisting of one folded-saddle and one folded-node.\nOne may ask why certain cases, in particular those without determinacy-breaking, were excluded by the proposition above. These are systems where the sliding phase portraits contain no orbits passing between the attracting and repelling sliding regions, and therefore one expects that in their blow up there should exists no canards connecting attracting and repelling branches of M S , and hence no folded singularities. If there are no such connections then no intersections between the two branches of M S persist when we let \u03b5 be nonzero. Hence the omission of these cases is consistent, and a posteori it is obviously necessary.\nIn figure 4 we illustrate the way splitting of manifolds occurs when we introduce the instantaneous timescale (whose derivative is denoted with a prime) with a fast timescale t/\u03b5 for \u03b5 > 0. The case shown is an invisible two-fold.  An in-depth description of the dynamics that ensues in the different cases of two-folds, and the smoothings subject to perturbations, would be lengthy, and deserves future study elsewhere.\nAs a demonstration we conclude with three examples of complex oscillatory attractors formed by two-fold singularities, simulated by smoothing. We take \u03b1 = 1/5 and: function \u03bb 1 = sign x 1 is replaced with a sigmoid function tanh(x 1 /\u03b5) with \u03b5 = 10 \u22125 . Because the system is structurally stable, the exact choice of smoothing function is not important so long as it is simple, for example continuous and monotonic, and further simulations not shown here verify that such dynamics persists with different smoothing functions, for example varying \u03b5, or replacing x 1 with a different sigmoid function such as x 1 / \u03b5 2 + x 2 1 . The first row shows the simulation of a single trajectory for a time interval t = 1000 in (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) space, as the flow attempts to switch between the critical slow manifold flow in (ii) given by the blow up on x 1 = 0, and the x 1 > 0 and x 1 < 0 flows in (i). In the second row we plot the familiar picture of sliding dynamics on x 1 = 0 for the unperturbed system (neglecting nonlinear \u03bb), and sketch the curvature of the x 1 = 0 flows.\nThe sliding vector field has canard trajectories passing from the righthand attracting branch to the lefthand repelling branch via the folded singularity; at a visible two-fold only one canard exists, at an invisible two-fold every sliding trajectory is a canard, and at a mixed two-fold a region of trajectories are canards. The third row shows the critical manifold M S in the (\u03bb 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) blow up.\n\nVI. CLOSING REMARKS\nFor such a simple system, even taking its piecewise linear local normal form, the two-fold exhibits intricate and varied dynamics. Just how intricate becomes even more clear as we attempt to regularize the discontinuity, and study how the two-fold related to slow-fast dynamics of smooth systems. As well as insight into the dynamics that is seen upon simulated such a system, this adds a new facet to the question of the structural stability of the two-fold, which has remained a stimulating question since [11].\nThe degeneracy in section IV gives some insight into why simulations of systems containing twofold singularities with determinacy-breaking singularities are highly unpredictable. In attempting to solve near a discontinuity, simulations may introduce aspects of smoothing, hysteresis, delay and noise, not represented in the ideal discontinuous model, with unpredictable effects on such a structurally unstable high codimension degeneracy. We therefore have to resolve this degeneracy before expecting to obtain comprehensible simulations, and without leaving the class of piecewise smooth systems, the nonlinear switching term introduced in the perturbed system in section V is sufficient.\nThe system (14) now succeeds (8) as our prototype for the local dynamics of the two-fold singularity (with \u03bb given by (5) in both cases). The question of whether this constitutes a 'normal form' has issues both in the discontinuous and slow-fast settings, but it is clear that (14) is structurally stable, and represents all classes of behaviour that occur both in the discontinuous system, and in its blow up to a slow-fast system.\nFinally we should emphasize that the results of this paper are equivalent if we smooth, rather than blow up, the discontinuity. In particular the degeneracy that makes the perturbation g = 0 necessary is still present. To relate the procedure of smoothing (or Sotomayor-Teixeira's regularization [13]) to the blow up procedure, we consider \u03bb as a function rather than a dynamic variable.\nA numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing: 1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

When the discontinuity in a piecewise smooth system is blown up or smoothed out at a two-fold singularity, the resulting system can be mapped onto a folded singularity. The result is not obvious, however, since it requires the presence of nonlinear or `hidden' terms at the discontinuity, which turn out to be necessary for structural stability of the blow up (or smoothing), and necessary for mapping to the folded singularity.\n\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nFor a local singularity that is so easy to define, the 'two-fold' singularity of piecewise-smooth dynamical systems has proven surprisingly difficult to characterize. It has been the subject of interest both for its intricate phase portrait [3,8], its ambiguous stability [10,11], and recently because of its role in determinacy-breaking [2]. Now that it seems these are all well understood, our interest in this paper is in how the local dynamics relates to that of smooth flows.\nIf a discontinuity occurs in the vector field of a flow on some hypersurface \u03a3, and the flow curves (or 'folds' parabolically) towards or away from \u03a3 on both sides of the surface, then under generic conditions the result is a two-fold singularity, as depicted in figure 1.\nStarting with [8,11], the elucidation of the two-fold singularity's dynamics can be traced through references in [3] (where the local form of the two-fold singularity is also extended to more than three dimensions). Though it can create limit cycles via a local bifurcation [2], the two-fold singularity itself is not an attractor. The main interest therefore lies in its transitory effects on a flow, (i) (  particularly in cases where it forms a bridge from an attracting region on the discontinuity surface into a repelling region, mimicking canard behaviour of smooth two-timescale systems [1] but with a more extreme character, because the two-fold breaks determinacy in both forward and backward time through the singularity. This is illustrated in figure 1 by a typical single trajectory entering the singularity, being deterministic until it does so, and afterwards exploding into a set-valued flow of infinite onward trajectories whose local form, however, is still somewhat constrained by the local geometry.\nParticularly because of some similarity to canard dynamics, attention has turned to how the twofold can be understood as a limit or approximation of a smooth flow. The topological equivalence between \"sliding\" motion along a discontinuity surface, and \"slow\" motion on invariant manifolds of smooth two-timescale systems, has been shown [13]. A qualitative connection has also been made between the sliding phase portraits at two-fold singularities and the slow manifold dynamics at so-called 'folded' singularities of two-timescale systems [4,5]. We shall prove here a more direct connection between the two singularities, by showing equivalence under explicit coordinate transformations.\nThe two singularities that concern us can be defined as isolated points in n \u2265 3 dimensions satisfying the following systems of equations: The two-fold singularity: The folded singularity: system : for j = 2, ..., n parameter : along with a number of non-degeneracy conditions, which state that immediate higher derivatives have typical (i.e. non-vanishing) values; these will be elaborated on later. The functions f i and g i are assumed to be differentiable with respect to their arguments. The parameter \u03bb introduces a discontinuity via the sign function, while \u03b5 introduces a separation into slow and fast timescales t and t/\u03b5 (where\u017c of course denotes the time derivative d dt z). Three dimensions are sufficient to understand the basic dynamics of either singularity, so henceforth we restrict to n = 3.\nIn an attempt to relate the two systems in (1), we might first observe that the folded singularity system becomes discontinuous in the singular \u03b5 \u2192 0 limit. However, that limit is not equivalent to the discontinuous system of the two-fold singularity in (1). To understand how the two systems in (1) are related we must instead start with the two-fold system, and somehow regularize the discontinuity to understand what forms of smooth system have it as a limit.\nRegularizing or smoothing a discontinuity raises immediate issues of uniqueness, namely that infinitely many qualitatively different smooth systems can have the same discontinuous limit. We shall find that actually this ambiguity can be encoded into the discontinuous system by means of nonlinear switching terms -nonlinear dependence on the parameter \u03bb in (1) -as introduced in [9] (sometimes called 'hidden' terms because they vanish everywhere except at the discontinuity).\nWe shall see that the smooth system obtained from a two-fold singularity is structurally unstable if it depends only linearly on \u03bb, and we shall show that a small perturbation, by terms that are nonlinear in \u03bb, restores structural stability and allows transformation into the general local singularity expected in a smooth system, namely the folded singularity.\nIn section II we introduce the normal form of the two-fold singularity, and outline the basic steps for its study by blowing up the discontinuity in section III. In section IV we blow up the normal piecewise smooth system, assuming only linear dependence on \u03bb as in the standard literature, giving a system which we find is structurally unstable. In section V we introduce a nonlinear perturbation of the normal form, then blow this up to find that it removes the structurally instability, and can be mapped onto the folded singularity of a smooth two timescale system. Remarks showing that these results follow also if we smooth, rather than blow up, the discontinuity, are given in section VI.\n\nII. THE TWO-FOLD SINGULARITY\nThe normal form of the two-fold singularity is in terms of constants a i = \u00b11 and b i \u2208 R. By results in [3,8,12], a system is locally approximated by (2) when it satisfies the conditions in the lefthand column of (1), along with non-degeneracy conditions stating that the flow curvature is quadratic, given by lim The local flow 'folds' towards or away from the switching surface x 1 = 0, along the line x 2 = x 1 = 0 on one side of the surface, and along the line x 3 = x 1 = 0 on the other. Hence the point where these lines cross is called the 'two-fold'. As a result, the surface x 1 = 0 is attractive in x 2 , x 3 > 0 and repulsive in x 2 , x 3 < 0, while trajectories cross the surface transversely in x 2 x 3 < 0.\nIn the attractive and repulsive regions the flow slides along the surface x 1 = 0, and the vector field it follows is found by interpolating across the discontinuity; we shall see how this is done below.\nThe qualitative picture is then as shown in figure 1. The precise form of the local dynamics depends on whether the flow curves towards or away from the discontinuity, determined by a 1 and a 2 , and also depends crucially on the quantity b 1 b 2 , which quantifies the jump in the angle of the flow across the discontinuity. An accounting of the many classes of dynamics that arise from these simple conditions is given in [3] and references therein, we give only the pertinent details here.\nThe three main 'flavours' of two-fold are: the visible two-fold for a 1 = a 2 = \u22121, the invisible two-fold for a 1 = a 2 = 1, and the mixed two-fold for a 1 a 2 = \u22121; an example of each is shown in figure 1 (i,ii,iii) respectively. In the cases depicted, there exist one or more trajectories passing from the attractive sliding region to the repelling sliding region, called canard orbits. This passage occurs in finite time (since the vector field (2) is non-vanishing everywhere locally). The flow is unique in forward time everywhere except in the repelling sliding region, where it is set-valued because trajectories may slide along x 1 = 0, but also be ejected into x 1 > 0 or x 1 < 0 at any point.\nThis means that the flow may evolve deterministically until it arrives at the singularity by means of a canard, at which point it becomes set-valued, so we say that determinacy breaking occurs at the singularity whenever canards are exhibited. This occurs in the invisible case when b 1 , b 2 < 0 and b 1 b 2 > 1, in the visible case when b 1 < 0 or b 2 < 0 or b 1 b 2 < 1, and finally in the mixed case We shall henceforth be concerned only with the dynamics that has previously been missing, that which occurs inside the discontinuity itself and gives rise to determinacy-breaking at the singularity.\nIn any event, the first step in studying the local dynamics must be to extend the system (2) in such a way that is can be solved across the discontinuity x 1 = 0, as follows.\n\nIII. BLOW UP\nWe shall outline the procedure for studying (2) in a general form first. Let x = (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) and , and begin with a piecewise-smooth syste\u1e41 which can be extended to x 1 = 0 by defining f as The function g is smooth, and provides f with a nonlinear dependence on \u03bb. Without g the function f (x; \u03bb) is the convex combination as used in Filippov's standard approach to switching [8], and here we shall introduce g = 0 only as a small perturbation when necessary.\nThe dynamics outside the discontinuity (x 1 = 0) is now given by taking either of \u03bb = \u00b11 in (4), which reproduces (3). On the discontinuity (x 1 = 0) we consider whether there exists \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1] such that\u1e8b 1 = 0, for which the flow of (4) lies in the tangent plane of the discontinuity, in which case sliding dynamics along the discontinuity surface is possible. The sliding dynamics can be reached in finite forward or backward time, meaning the flow can lose or gain a dimension as it arrives at or departs from x 1 = 0, so the resulting flow might not be unique. Therefore we shall follow [9] and regain uniqueness by blowing up the discontinuity manifold x 1 = 0, to study the dynamics of \u03bb that transports the flow through the jump between \u22121 and +1. This is done as follows.\nBecause \u03bb is a function of x 1 only, the dynamics of \u03bb is induced by the x 1 component of the where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to some dummy timescale, instantaneous compared to the main timescale. One way to describe this is to say \u03bb \u2032 \u2261 \u03b5 d\u03bb dt for infinitesimal \u03b5 > 0. (In fact, this blow up is equivalent to defining \u03bb as a function we discuss this further in section VI). We obtain for the blow up system on x 1 = 0, The steady states of the 'fast' prime system satisfy a differential-algebraic system which defines dynamics on an invariant manifold The system (7)  The systems (4) and (6) are sufficient to specify the local dynamics, and we shall now apply these to the normal form. The final step in our analysis will be to transform the system (6) into the normal form of a folded singularity, but we shall find that this is only possible if g is nonzero, and hence there is a nonlinear dependence on \u03bb.\n\nIV. THE UNPERTURBED SYSTEM\nIn this section we show the following.\nProposition 1. The blow-up (6) of the normal form two-fold singularity (2) with g \u2261 0 is structurally unstable.\nTo prove this we will perform the blow up described in section I, and show that the sliding manifold M S exhibits a degeneracy.\nTo resolve the dynamics across the discontinuity, we use (4) to express the system (2) as a convex combination : Using the blow-up (6) on x 1 = 0 we obtain the two timescale system with \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1]. The fast system on \u03bb \u2032 has equilibria where \u03bb \u2032 = 0, yielding a differential- This describes states that evolve inside the switching surface x 1 = 0 on the main timescale, and these are precisely Filippov's sliding modes. We can solve in the sliding mode to get \u03bb = (x 3 \u2212 x 2 )/(x 3 + x 2 ), and sliding modes exist only when this lies in the allowed range \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1], hence In the absence of sliding modes, where x 2 x 3 < 0, equation (9) describes the instantaneous transition from one boundary of \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1] to another, whereby the flow crosses through the switching surface as \u03bb flips sign.\nConcerning the sliding regions x 2 x 3 > 0 on x 1 = 0, the subsystem (10) inhabits invariant manifolds of the blow-up system (9) given by We call M S the sliding manifold. It consists of two normally hyperbolic branches, one attractive in x 2 , x 3 > 0 since \u2202\u03bb \u2032 /\u2202\u03bb = \u2212(x 3 + x 2 )/2 < 0, and one repulsive in x 2 , x 3 < 0 since \u2202\u03bb \u2032 /\u2202\u03bb = \u2212(x 3 + x 2 )/2 > 0. The two branches are connected at x 2 = x 3 = 0, along a line Along L we have \u2202\u03bb \u2032 /\u2202\u03bb = 0, so the manifold M S is no longer normally hyperbolic where it meets L, and therefore is not invariant there. Figure 2 shows an example of the discontinuous system (i), and its blow-up (ii) showing M S and L, rotated in (iii) to show L more clearly. The dynamics in the manifold is best viewed along the u 3 axis of rotated coordinates The line L represents the two-fold singularity (x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = 0), stretched out over the interval \u03bb \u2208 [\u22121, +1] in the blow up. Comparing the alignment of L with the dynamics outside M S , however, reveals a degeneracy in the system (9). The non-hyperbolic set L is a line with tangent vector e L = (1, 0, 0) in the space of (\u03bb, x 2 , x 3 ), which means it lies everywhere parallel to the fast one-dimensional \u03bb \u2032 system in (9). As a result, all along L we have not only \u2202f 1 /\u2202\u03bb = 0, but also \u2202 2 f 1 /\u2202\u03bb 2 = 0 and moreover \u2202 r f 1 /\u2202\u03bb r = 0 for all r > 1. This constitutes an infinite codimension degeneracy, so the system is structurally unstable. This is the result in the proposition.\n\nRemarks on the degeneracy\nThe degeneracy means that the flow is not transverse to the set L where the two sheets of M S intersect. As a result, if we perturb the system, transversal intersection between the attracting and repelling branches of the invariant manifold M S cannot be guaranteed, see e.g. [14]. Small changes in the expression (8)  In the literature on smooth two timescale systems (as we have here in (\u03bb, x 2 , x 3 ) space), the connection of attracting and repelling branches of a slow invariant manifold has been well studied, leading to a generic canonical form and requisite non-degeneracy conditions as described in [14].\nIn our notation those conditions are the existence of a point on L where the fourth of which is violated everywhere in the system described above.\nAdding constant terms or powers of x 2 and x 3 to (8) would only move the set L in the (x 2 , x 3 ) plane, not remove its degeneracy, and terms depending on x 1 would vanish at the discontinuity.\nThe only recourse to break the degeneracy, particularly to give \u2202 2 f 1 \u2202\u03bb 2 = 0, is therefore to add terms nonlinear in \u03bb. Anything we add to the function f 1 in (8) must still give (2), so it must vanish outside the switching surface x 1 = 0, i.e. be a perturbation of the form (4), as we introduce in the next section.\n\nV. THE PERTURBED SYSTEM\nIn this section we show the following.\nProposition 2. The blow-up (6) of the normal form two-fold singularity (2) with g = (\u03b1, 0, 0) can be transformed into provided \u03b1 = 0 for small \u03b5 > 0, where a, b, c, are real constants, and provided the conditions It turns out that the case excluded by the conditions \u00b1 1 2 (b 1 \u2212 b 2 ) \u2264 1 = \u00b1a 1 = \u2213a 2 is that in which there are no canards or faux-canards, i.e. no orbits of the sliding flow passing through the singularity.\nOn x 1 = 0 we consider the blow up of (14) as before, now giving This is an \u03b1-perturbation of (9). The \u03bb \u2032 system has equilibria on the set The surface described by M S forms an invariant manifold of (15) at all points where it is normally hyperbolic, i.e. where \u2202\u03bb \u2032 \u2202\u03bb = 0, which now holds except on the curve The curve L has tangent vector e L = (1 , +2\u03b1(\u03bb \u2212 1) , \u22122\u03b1(\u03bb + 1)), which for all |\u03bb| \u2264 1 is transverse to the flow if \u03b1 = 0. In particular L is now transverse to the dot and prime timescale subsystems in (15), so the degeneracy of the unperturbed system has been broken. We show below that this perturbed \u03b1 = 0 system is structurally stable by mapping the two timescale blow-up system (15) Denoting the value of f i at the singularity as f is , and solving (18) via we find that the folded singularity lies at (\u03bb, x 2 , x 3 ) = (\u03bb s , x 2s , x 3s ) where Noting that a 1 and a 2 just takes values \u00b11, we have: , so there exists a unique \u03bb s \u2208 [\u22121, +1] for any b 1 and b 2 (the positive root for b 1 > b 2 , the negative root for b 1 < b 2 ); , so there exists a unique \u03bb s \u2208 [\u22121, +1] for any b 1 and b 2 (the positive root for b 1 < b 2 , the negative root for b 1 > b 2 ); , there exist two points with \u03bb s \u2208 [\u22121, +1] for b 1 \u2212 b 2 > 2, and no points otherwise.\nand no points otherwise.\nIn the cases where \u03bb s is unique we proceed directly to the steps that follow below. In the cases where \u03bb s can take two values we can proceed with the following analysis about each value, and will obtain different constants in the final local expression, i.e. a different folded singularity corresponding to each \u03bb s . In the cases when \u03bb s does not exist, no equivalence can be formed; these are the cases when the the two-fold's sliding portrait is of focal type (see [3]) where orbits winds around the two-fold but sliding orbits never enter or leave it. So excluding those cases a 1 = \u2212a 2 = 1 with we can proceed as follows.\nIt is more useful to parameterize L in terms of y 3 , which we obtain as L : in terms of three functions y 1L , y 2L , y 3L , whose derivatives are Since x \u2032 \u2261 \u03b5\u1e8b this is the result in the proposition, and it is clearly valid only for \u03b1 = 0. Figure 5 shows an example of the perturbed system and its blow up for each flavour of two-fold in (i) (corresponding to those in figure 1), followed by their blow up (ii), and a rotation (iii) to show the phase portrait around the set L more clearly (similar to figure 2). In the most extreme case, the folded node, the original phase portrait contains infinitely many intersecting trajectories traversing the singularity, while the perturbed system splits these into distinguishable orbits, a finite number of which asymptote to the attracting and repelling branches of the critical manifold.\n\nRemarks on the singularity\nA glance at the papers [6,14,15] reveals what a charismatic singularity lies hidden in the dynamics of the two-fold, revealed by blow-up, and waiting to be released when the discontinuous system is perturbed by simulations that smooth, regularize, or otherwise approximate the discontinuity.\nIn particular one may ask what happens in the cases of determinacy-breaking illustrated in figure 1, since a smooth flow should be deterministic. Because the two-fold maps to a folded singularity (actually one or two folded singularities as we saw above), if we consider what happens with \u03b5 > 0 we find determinacy is restored, but replaced by sensitivity to initial conditions.\nThe manifold M S becomes the slow critical manifold of a slow-fast system, and for \u03b5 by standard results of geometric singular perturbation theory [7], there exist invariant manifolds M S \u03b5 in the \u03b5-neighbourhood of M S but away from L, on which the dynamics is topologically equivalent to the sliding dynamics (termed 'reduced' or slow dynamics usually in this context) found above.\nTrajectories that pass close to the singularity, or more precisely, close to the folded singularity on the set L, may persist in following the manifold M S from its stable to unstable branches, while other nearby trajectories will veer wildly away, their fate sensitive to initial conditions and proximity to primary canard orbits (those which persist along both branches of M S throughout the local region).\nLike the different kinds of two-fold, there are different classes of folded singularity, and their classification depends on the slow dynamics inside M S . From the expressions (29)-(30) we see that the class therefore depends not only on the constants a 1 , a 2 , b 1 , b 2 , of the original piecewise smooth system, but also on the 'hidden' parameter \u03b1. The classification scheme is fairly simple, and can be used to verify the dynamics on M S seen in figure 3. The projection of the system (29) onto M S , found by differentiating the condition 0 =x 2 +x 2 1 with respect to time to give 0 =bx 3 +cx A classification then follows by neglecting the singular prefactor 1/2x 1 and considering whether the phase portrait is that of a focus, a node, or a saddle. This is determined by the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix Jacobian, which has tracec, determinant 2\u00e3b, and eigenvalues 1 2 (c \u00b1 c 2 \u2212 8\u00e3b). This will not be the true system's phase portrait because the time-scaling from the 1/2x 1 factor is positive in the attractive branch of M S , negative (time-reversing) in the repulsive branch, and divergent at the singularity (turning infinite time convergence to the singularity into finite time passage through the singularity). The effect of this is to 'fold' together attracting and repelling pairs of each equilibrium type, so each equilibrium becomes a 'folded-equilibrium', forming a continuous bridge between branches of M S . As a result the flow on M S is a folded-saddle if\u00e3b < 0, a folded-node if 0 < 8\u00e3b <c 2 , and a folded-focus ifc 2 < 8\u00e3b. Canard cases occur forc > 0 and faux canard for c < 0. In figure 3 we show the result of blowing up the discontinuous system for an example of each type of two-fold that exhibits determinacy-breaking (those from figure 1). In the visible two-fold the singularity becomes a folded-saddle, in the invisible case it becomes a folded-node, while the mixed case becomes a pair consisting of one folded-saddle and one folded-node.\nOne may ask why certain cases, in particular those without determinacy-breaking, were excluded by the proposition above. These are systems where the sliding phase portraits contain no orbits passing between the attracting and repelling sliding regions, and therefore one expects that in their blow up there should exists no canards connecting attracting and repelling branches of M S , and hence no folded singularities. If there are no such connections then no intersections between the two branches of M S persist when we let \u03b5 be nonzero. Hence the omission of these cases is consistent, and a posteori it is obviously necessary.\nIn figure 4 we illustrate the way splitting of manifolds occurs when we introduce the instantaneous timescale (whose derivative is denoted with a prime) with a fast timescale t/\u03b5 for \u03b5 > 0. The case shown is an invisible two-fold.  An in-depth description of the dynamics that ensues in the different cases of two-folds, and the smoothings subject to perturbations, would be lengthy, and deserves future study elsewhere.\nAs a demonstration we conclude with three examples of complex oscillatory attractors formed by two-fold singularities, simulated by smoothing. We take \u03b1 = 1/5 and: function \u03bb 1 = sign x 1 is replaced with a sigmoid function tanh(x 1 /\u03b5) with \u03b5 = 10 \u22125 . Because the system is structurally stable, the exact choice of smoothing function is not important so long as it is simple, for example continuous and monotonic, and further simulations not shown here verify that such dynamics persists with different smoothing functions, for example varying \u03b5, or replacing x 1 with a different sigmoid function such as x 1 / \u03b5 2 + x 2 1 . The first row shows the simulation of a single trajectory for a time interval t = 1000 in (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) space, as the flow attempts to switch between the critical slow manifold flow in (ii) given by the blow up on x 1 = 0, and the x 1 > 0 and x 1 < 0 flows in (i). In the second row we plot the familiar picture of sliding dynamics on x 1 = 0 for the unperturbed system (neglecting nonlinear \u03bb), and sketch the curvature of the x 1 = 0 flows.\nThe sliding vector field has canard trajectories passing from the righthand attracting branch to the lefthand repelling branch via the folded singularity; at a visible two-fold only one canard exists, at an invisible two-fold every sliding trajectory is a canard, and at a mixed two-fold a region of trajectories are canards. The third row shows the critical manifold M S in the (\u03bb 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) blow up.\n\nVI. CLOSING REMARKS\nFor such a simple system, even taking its piecewise linear local normal form, the two-fold exhibits intricate and varied dynamics. Just how intricate becomes even more clear as we attempt to regularize the discontinuity, and study how the two-fold related to slow-fast dynamics of smooth systems. As well as insight into the dynamics that is seen upon simulated such a system, this adds a new facet to the question of the structural stability of the two-fold, which has remained a stimulating question since [11].\nThe degeneracy in section IV gives some insight into why simulations of systems containing twofold singularities with determinacy-breaking singularities are highly unpredictable. In attempting to solve near a discontinuity, simulations may introduce aspects of smoothing, hysteresis, delay and noise, not represented in the ideal discontinuous model, with unpredictable effects on such a structurally unstable high codimension degeneracy. We therefore have to resolve this degeneracy before expecting to obtain comprehensible simulations, and without leaving the class of piecewise smooth systems, the nonlinear switching term introduced in the perturbed system in section V is sufficient.\nThe system (14) now succeeds (8) as our prototype for the local dynamics of the two-fold singularity (with \u03bb given by (5) in both cases). The question of whether this constitutes a 'normal form' has issues both in the discontinuous and slow-fast settings, but it is clear that (14) is structurally stable, and represents all classes of behaviour that occur both in the discontinuous system, and in its blow up to a slow-fast system.\nFinally we should emphasize that the results of this paper are equivalent if we smooth, rather than blow up, the discontinuity. In particular the degeneracy that makes the perturbation g = 0 necessary is still present. To relate the procedure of smoothing (or Sotomayor-Teixeira's regularization [13]) to the blow up procedure, we consider \u03bb as a function rather than a dynamic variable.\nA numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing: 1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

The Rotten Tomatoes site provides a useful round-up. Whether the film is anti-Semitic isn't a settled issue, but it seems to be no more anti-Semitic than the gospels themselves. Unfortunately, that means that there are some anti-Jewish elements in the film, because the source material -- the New Testament -- doesn't exactly portray the braying Jewish mob and scheming high priests in a very flattering way. After all, the gospels were written in the early decades of the Christian church by writers eager to make the case for their new religion against the old one, Judaism, all under the domineering presence of the Roman Empire. So naturally, Pilate is portrayed as an indecisive moderate swayed by the angry Jewish mob. That's what the gospels say (e.g., Matthew 27), take it or leave it.

According to this view, the Jews should have left the scene. Their continued survival seemed to be an act of stubborn defiance.

His mother, who was not Jewish, joined the family shortly after.\n\u201cI was lucky because some never saw their parents again,\u201d he said.\nDubs never returned to Czechoslovakia \u2013 \u201cmy future was in Britain\u201d \u2013 and after a lifetime in politics he was appointed a Labour peer in 1994, earning him the title of Baron Dubs.\nThe father-of-two has twice visited \u201cThe Jungle\u201d in France, where many inhabitants are not much older than Dubs was on the Kinderstransport train.\nIs there a modern-day equivalent to Nicholas Winton, the British stockbroker who founded the Kindertransport scheme?\n\u201cSadly, I don\u2019t think there is,\u201d he said.\nA numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing: 1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

But there are some great examples that we have seen and we can try to abstract this to bring the best practice of how people, process and technology should come together.\nBuilding the product content ecosystem all at once is a nearly impossible task. Start with key components, and, as long as you have a clear strategy and a roadmap of how all of the components will eventually come together, you can, and really should, build the ecosystem piece by piece.\nBefore starting with the technology, you need to look at the context of your organisation, your existing technical capabilities, and map out the people journey and data process to come up with a holistic ecosystem that you can develop.\nThe trigger to create new content could be a new product to be launched, or an existing product to be refreshed, or there\u2019s a gap of your product content presence online. Typically, the initial requirement is raised by your brand team, Ecommerce team, customer insight teams, account manager on retailer sites, etc.\nOnce the content requirement is triggered, there needs to be a clear brief and instruction on what content is to be created. You are working with your internal design team or external agencies for creative briefing. Typically, this is managed in a Project Management System where you can track your campaigns and delivery schedules to make sure the brief is accurately executed and ready for final approval.\nGoing on to the next stage is Product Information Management (PIM) system. PIM is usually integrated with upstream ERP platforms (e.g. SAP) to store and manage your core product information (e.g. GTIN, EAN/barcode, which country the product is created for, etc.). It also receives product technical information (e.g. product weight, size, legal and nutrition information, etc.) from a variety of sources within your organisation. This particular area is the one that you shouldn\u2019t speed through as you need to ensure the source of truth is properly orchestrated and governed to identify unique products accurately and consistently in downstream processes and systems.\nThis is the stage where you have the digital assets that have been briefed, approved and these fly straight from the Project Management System into Digital Asset Management (DAM) or manually uploaded into DAM directly. At some point, you need to link the asset to product data record that comes from PIM. It is crucial and important to make sure the person/team who is linking the asset and product data record knows the information. For example, if your brand team or agency is responsible for asset creation and is asked to upload assets into DAM and link the asset to product data record, make sure they are briefed on what product record to link to. We\u2019ve seen in many cases that marketing and agency teams simply don\u2019t know what product record should be linked to the asset (as they just don\u2019t have the information available from the briefing, so it\u2019s very difficult for them to create that connection). Essentially, it\u2019s not about how to use the tools, but about orchestrating your data across systems and connecting the dots throughout business processes.\nPIM and DAM are the two crucial components across the digital ecosystem and different life-cycles you need to manage. PIM manages the lifecycle of your product, whilst DAM is a single point of truth of managing the life-cycle of your digital assets. And those are two different things. Your product might no longer be on shelf, but the digital assets may still be re-usable in different channels (e.g. print, OOH). And the other way around. You have a digital asset with expired usage rights, but the product is still valid and needs to be sold. Building PIM and DAM in parallel is an ideal approach, but if you already have one in place, make sure you adopt the same data orchestration when building the other.\nCome on to the content distribution stage where you send all the combined product content (including marketing copy, product data, digital assets) to online stores or retailer sites. Typically, there are three different \u201cflavours\u201d of content distribution: (1) interim solution via syndicators and aggregators (e.g. BrandBank in UK, Equadis in France, Salsify in US) which effectively means building a global API between your internal ecosystem and third-party platform (the latter directly integrates with local retailers); or establishing a product content portal via (2) \u201cPush\u201d or (3) \u201cPull\u201d mechanism to distribute content to retailers.\nFinally, going to the content auditing and reporting stage. There are lots of data analytics solutions out there to help you evaluate how complete your digital shelf looks and how your brands are doing compared with your competitors, without going through a manual audit process. Whichever platform you choose, the key point is, that, to make these auditing solutions truly effective, they need to have a single source of truth (i.e. your PIM and DAM) to cross-reference and compare against, then indicate how accurate and compliant your product content is. This then brings the whole process right back to the original stage to act as the \u201ccontent trigger\u201d to close the content gap.\nTo reiterate what we said at the beginning, you don\u2019t have to build all the solutions all at once. We have clients who have started the ecosystem journey with just DAM, then integrated with PIM, then added analytics solution afterwards. We also work with clients who implemented PIM and DAM solutions together at the same time.\nThe key point is, what you have built (or are building, or going to build in the future), adds a really essential piece to your wider marketing technology ecosystem - your websites, social media platforms, campaign management tools, mobile apps, etc. Your product data and digital assets are re-usable not just by taking content from other channels for Ecommerce, but the other way around as well (as we illustrate in the diagram below).\nIn the next blog (which is the last one of this series), we will give away key watch-outs and top-tips on where to begin with the digital shelf journey for your brand(s).", "prompt": "Every single marketing technology ecosystem for every organisation is different.\nTrying to distil the content in terms of what the product content ecosystem should look like is a tricky task.

We wasted no time getting out of town! On the 14th we drove out to Miles End Lodge in Kingston in central NV for a two night stay. We brought the side by side and dirt bikes. Our friends Alice and Chuck and Steve and their friend Gary were out there too with dirt bikes for the guys. So Alice and I had fun taking turns driving the side by side up Kingston Canyon and down the other side. We had some fun water crossings.\nWe loved seeing everything so green after the abundant snow year.\nAndy and Stan accompanied us on dirt bikes.\nI love that place so much that we will be back in two weeks.\nThen we left the next day in our motorhome for a trip to Portland, Oregon to visit my sister Catherine and her family. Andy and his cousin Sam would be taking a sailing class on the Wiillamate River. It was two days of long drives with beautiful views of snow covered volcanoes, including Mt. Shasta from the south, east, and north! We camped the first night at Sunset Campground at Lake of the Woods.\nIt was the only reservation I could find on short notice and it worked out well. It was a great campground with a beautiful lake and a beautiful snow covered volcano, plus it was 45 minutes from the only entrance to Crater Lake National Park that was open because of snow removal continuing on most of the roads in the park. So after a lazy Father\u2019s Day morning at the campground, we drove to the south entrance of Crater Lake National Park. There was a long line of vehicles waiting to turn in from both directions. We finally made it up to a ranger taking money standing in the road before the pay station. We asked if it would be reasonable to drive our motor home up to the rim with our tow vehicle and he said, \u201cNo problem, there is oversize vehicle parking up there.\u201d So we drove up to the very crowded Rim Village \u2013 lunch time on Father\u2019s Day with perfect weather. There were cars parked everywhere, including in all of the RV/Bus sites. So we waited for someone to leave. The problem was with 6 RV/bus sites that meant 12 cars and we would need to have two in the same site leave at the same time. When one car left I got out to save the place. Then another car left in another spot. So now I was saving two places. Then another motorhome arrived towing a Jeep. The couple was from California and they joined us in the effort to keep cars out of the RV sites. I had my Boogie Board and it was perfect!\nI blocked cars from turning into the area and felt very powerful with my Boogie Board! There was one car I blocked from turning into an empty spot and they drove around and started to turn into an empty spot on the other side so I ran over there again with my sign (and the handkerchief in my mouth!) and held up the sign again. There were also plenty of people from other countries who looked like they didn\u2019t know what my sign said so I had to point to a motorhome. It was actually kind of fun and definitely camaraderie with the other motorhome people. A third motor home had joined us in our effort. Even after we finally got parked I felt like I should stay out there all afternoon enforcing, but Stan pointed out that it was no longer our battle. He was right of course. Stan and Andy had sandwiches during the hour this took. But I still had to eat and I got to have lunch with a great view.\nIt was worth the wait for such beauty. Andy also had fun shoe skiing down from the Rim Lodge roof.\nAfter that we continued to Portland, arriving around 9 P.M. Because it was late, we decided to meet my sister and nephew at the sailing class at 9 A.M. the next day. We got all checked into our RV Park and got to bed.\nOn Monday we got Andy to the Willamette Sailing Club at 9:05 A.M. becasue of traffic. But he only missed a little bit of the Safety Introduction and he had done this camp before. Andy is sailing with the teens in Lasers and Sam is with the younger kids in Optis. We stayed through their swim tests.\nThey had to don their life jackets in the water, but ony got them after telling a joke or a riddle.\nThen my sister Cath, Stan and I went to a nearby Starbucks to chat. We looked up at the bulletin board and at first glance it looled like it said Welcome to Stan Macdonald.\nActually it says Welcome to Starbucks on Macadam.\nThere is a climbing gym right in the same area so Andy and Sam spent parts of the afternoons climbling.\nWe had a nice bbq dinner on the new deck at Cathy and Rick\u2019s house. This was in the waning twilight between 9 and 10 P.M.\nOn Tuesday Stan and I had a lazy morning, then met Cath and the boys for a Taco lunch then more climbing. On Tuesday night we went to dinner at their Jewish Community Center \u2013 it smelled so good.\nCath, Rick, Sam, and Andy walked the few hilly blocks from their home to the center, while Stan and I drove.\nWednesday brought more of the same. The boys had plenty of wind for sailing and got to cover quite a bit of that lovely part of the Willamette River with bridges and an island. And then more climbing gym. On Wednesday night we got together with Stan\u2019s cousins David and Dana and their families at a Cambodian Sports Bar. It was so much fun, and wonderful to connect with family we hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. Almost the whole group, missing only Dana.\nOn Thursday, Rick, who is an Emergency Room doctor, was off work. I asked if it would be possible to go to Mt. St. Helens in Washington, about an hour and a half north of Portland. It turns out to be one of their favorite places. Could we do it in half a day, after sailing ended at noon? We decided we could because it was one of the longest daylight days of our year.\nSo the geology-loving part of me was fulfilled. I had been in Geology 101 at University of Illinois in May of 1980 when the big eruption occurred. It was REALLY cool at the time to have a professor explain the geology of an active volcano on the west coast of my own country. And now I got to see it!\nIt was another perfect weather day. We stopped at an overlook on the way up, and there was a guy there with a spotting scope focused on three elk. There are three elk on the right side of this photo on the little hill, but without the spotting scope we would not have known.\nThe wildflowers were beautiful.\nWe made it to the Johnston Observatory just in time for the last movie of the day.\nCousins after the movie.\nWe attended the last ranger talk of the day, standing outside. It was time for me to do my meds, including grinding them. My sister was so kind that she got me a wheelchair to sit in during the talk so I could get meds done. The talk was given by a Forest Service Intern from Germany and his presentation was superb. No the man in the background is not standing on the table!\nThen we walked up a trail that went up and around the hill on the left side of the photo.\nThere was a memorial for all the people who died on that Sunday morning in May 1980 when the volcano erupted.\nThis day ended with dinner at Lucky Dragon Chinese restaurant on the way back to Oregon. Rick\u2019s fortune cookie said \u201cYou have great patience\u201d which is true and he also has great patients (veterans). Stan\u2019s fortune said \u201cYou will soon meet an old friend\u201d which also was true.\nOn Friday I met my sister at the Hoyt Arboretum. She likes to hike there as often as she can. I met her after her hike and we found a shaded picnic table and sat and had a sisterly chat. It was nice to see that part of Portland. Then Cath showed me around downtown Portland, including this actual city park.\nOn Friday night, we went to a play. It was called The Pianist of Williston Lane and was a beautiful yet sad story of a woman saved by the kindertransport during the World War II holocaust which moved Jewish children to England, which is Rick\u2019s mother\u2019s story too. And after the play, Ben and Jerry\u2019s Ice Cream.\nThen on Saturday, the day we had to leave, Cathy, Rick, and Sam came to our motorhome for brunch.\nThen we headed south on I-5 and went to visit old friends in Trail, Oregon.\nLinda and David retired from Desert Research Institute 14 years ago and moved to Oregon and are now living on a beautiful farm.\nStan and David talked for hours about their shared technological and other interests. Andy helped Linda build a dam on the creek to make a swimming hole for their dogs. Linda and I talked about knitting and yarns. She spins her own yarn. They were wonderful hosts, and it was wonderful to catch up with old friends.\nOn the way home today we will meet another old friend in Klamath Falls.\nThese have been great trips of love and connection.\nIt gave me great pleasure to read about your trip. Beautiful sights, loving family, happy boys doing fun things together \u2013 life can be so very good. I am a friend of your step mother, Anita. A friend of mine also has ALS so I have double interest in your journey.\nThanks Meg for writing such a nice recap of our great visit together during Samuel\u2019s first week of summer vacation! What a treat it was for all of us to spend a late spring week in Portland with you, and for the boy cousins to share sailing camp and climbing fun! Mt.St.Helens is my favorite Pacific NW mountain site and I loved visiting it again with you as a newbie and a geologist. As I said on my early birthday card for you, knowing that this next birthday on June 30 will be a one-year ALS diagnosis anniversary, this past year you have shown with all your energy that Love, Connection and Hope are much stronger than any disease symptoms. Would that your choice of positive focus lead to treatment and recovery by some miraculous intervention!\nMeg, I love these pictures and the fact that you can get to these fabulous places relatively easily. The Hackett family and some friends (15 of us) just got back from an Alaskan adventure on June 29th. Your pictures are very similar to what we saw, which was my 1st time in that kind of rugged terrain with the snow capped mountains and cool temps. It was totally awesome and we all came back refreshed and energized. I hope you can keep having these outdoor experiences, its good for the soul. BTW, Janine and family had a nice short visit with Cathy when they were in D.C. recently too.

So after a lazy Father\u2019s Day morning at the campground, we drove to the south entrance of Crater Lake National Park. There was a long line of vehicles waiting to turn in from both directions. We finally made it up to a ranger taking money standing in the road before the pay station. We asked if it would be reasonable to drive our motor home up to the rim with our tow vehicle and he said, \u201cNo problem, there is oversize vehicle parking up there.\u201d So we drove up to the very crowded Rim Village \u2013 lunch time on Father\u2019s Day with perfect weather. There were cars parked everywhere, including in all of the RV/Bus sites. So we waited for someone to leave. The problem was with 6 RV/bus sites that meant 12 cars and we would need to have two in the same site leave at the same time. When one car left I got out to save the place. Then another car left in another spot. So now I was saving two places. Then another motorhome arrived towing a Jeep. The couple was from California and they joined us in the effort to keep cars out of the RV sites. I had my Boogie Board and it was perfect!\nI blocked cars from turning into the area and felt very powerful with my Boogie Board! There was one car I blocked from turning into an empty spot and they drove around and started to turn into an empty spot on the other side so I ran over there again with my sign (and the handkerchief in my mouth!) and held up the sign again. There were also plenty of people from other countries who looked like they didn\u2019t know what my sign said so I had to point to a motorhome. It was actually kind of fun and definitely camaraderie with the other motorhome people. A third motor home had joined us in our effort. Even after we finally got parked I felt like I should stay out there all afternoon enforcing, but Stan pointed out that it was no longer our battle. He was right of course. Stan and Andy had sandwiches during the hour this took. But I still had to eat and I got to have lunch with a great view.\nIt was worth the wait for such beauty. Andy also had fun shoe skiing down from the Rim Lodge roof.\nAfter that we continued to Portland, arriving around 9 P.M. Because it was late, we decided to meet my sister and nephew at the sailing class at 9 A.M. the next day. We got all checked into our RV Park and got to bed.\nOn Monday we got Andy to the Willamette Sailing Club at 9:05 A.M. becasue of traffic. But he only missed a little bit of the Safety Introduction and he had done this camp before. Andy is sailing with the teens in Lasers and Sam is with the younger kids in Optis. We stayed through their swim tests.\nThey had to don their life jackets in the water, but ony got them after telling a joke or a riddle.\nThen my sister Cath, Stan and I went to a nearby Starbucks to chat. We looked up at the bulletin board and at first glance it looled like it said Welcome to Stan Macdonald.\nActually it says Welcome to Starbucks on Macadam.\nThere is a climbing gym right in the same area so Andy and Sam spent parts of the afternoons climbling.\nWe had a nice bbq dinner on the new deck at Cathy and Rick\u2019s house. This was in the waning twilight between 9 and 10 P.M.\nOn Tuesday Stan and I had a lazy morning, then met Cath and the boys for a Taco lunch then more climbing. On Tuesday night we went to dinner at their Jewish Community Center \u2013 it smelled so good.\nCath, Rick, Sam, and Andy walked the few hilly blocks from their home to the center, while Stan and I drove.\nWednesday brought more of the same. The boys had plenty of wind for sailing and got to cover quite a bit of that lovely part of the Willamette River with bridges and an island. And then more climbing gym. On Wednesday night we got together with Stan\u2019s cousins David and Dana and their families at a Cambodian Sports Bar. It was so much fun, and wonderful to connect with family we hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. Almost the whole group, missing only Dana.\nOn Thursday, Rick, who is an Emergency Room doctor, was off work. I asked if it would be possible to go to Mt. St. Helens in Washington, about an hour and a half north of Portland. It turns out to be one of their favorite places. Could we do it in half a day, after sailing ended at noon? We decided we could because it was one of the longest daylight days of our year.\nSo the geology-loving part of me was fulfilled. I had been in Geology 101 at University of Illinois in May of 1980 when the big eruption occurred. It was REALLY cool at the time to have a professor explain the geology of an active volcano on the west coast of my own country. And now I got to see it!\nIt was another perfect weather day. We stopped at an overlook on the way up, and there was a guy there with a spotting scope focused on three elk. There are three elk on the right side of this photo on the little hill, but without the spotting scope we would not have known.\nThe wildflowers were beautiful.\nWe made it to the Johnston Observatory just in time for the last movie of the day.\nCousins after the movie.\nWe attended the last ranger talk of the day, standing outside. It was time for me to do my meds, including grinding them. My sister was so kind that she got me a wheelchair to sit in during the talk so I could get meds done. The talk was given by a Forest Service Intern from Germany and his presentation was superb. No the man in the background is not standing on the table!\nThen we walked up a trail that went up and around the hill on the left side of the photo.\nThere was a memorial for all the people who died on that Sunday morning in May 1980 when the volcano erupted.\nThis day ended with dinner at Lucky Dragon Chinese restaurant on the way back to Oregon. Rick\u2019s fortune cookie said \u201cYou have great patience\u201d which is true and he also has great patients (veterans). Stan\u2019s fortune said \u201cYou will soon meet an old friend\u201d which also was true.\nOn Friday I met my sister at the Hoyt Arboretum. She likes to hike there as often as she can. I met her after her hike and we found a shaded picnic table and sat and had a sisterly chat. It was nice to see that part of Portland. Then Cath showed me around downtown Portland, including this actual city park.\nOn Friday night, we went to a play. It was called The Pianist of Williston Lane and was a beautiful yet sad story of a woman saved by the kindertransport during the World War II holocaust which moved Jewish children to England, which is Rick\u2019s mother\u2019s story too. And after the play, Ben and Jerry\u2019s Ice Cream.\nThen on Saturday, the day we had to leave, Cathy, Rick, and Sam came to our motorhome for brunch.\nThen we headed south on I-5 and went to visit old friends in Trail, Oregon.\nLinda and David retired from Desert Research Institute 14 years ago and moved to Oregon and are now living on a beautiful farm.\nStan and David talked for hours about their shared technological and other interests. Andy helped Linda build a dam on the creek to make a swimming hole for their dogs. Linda and I talked about knitting and yarns. She spins her own yarn. They were wonderful hosts, and it was wonderful to catch up with old friends.\nOn the way home today we will meet another old friend in Klamath Falls.\nThese have been great trips of love and connection.\nIt gave me great pleasure to read about your trip. Beautiful sights, loving family, happy boys doing fun things together \u2013 life can be so very good. I am a friend of your step mother, Anita. A friend of mine also has ALS so I have double interest in your journey.\nThanks Meg for writing such a nice recap of our great visit together during Samuel\u2019s first week of summer vacation! What a treat it was for all of us to spend a late spring week in Portland with you, and for the boy cousins to share sailing camp and climbing fun! Mt.St.Helens is my favorite Pacific NW mountain site and I loved visiting it again with you as a newbie and a geologist. As I said on my early birthday card for you, knowing that this next birthday on June 30 will be a one-year ALS diagnosis anniversary, this past year you have shown with all your energy that Love, Connection and Hope are much stronger than any disease symptoms. Would that your choice of positive focus lead to treatment and recovery by some miraculous intervention!\nMeg, I love these pictures and the fact that you can get to these fabulous places relatively easily. The Hackett family and some friends (15 of us) just got back from an Alaskan adventure on June 29th. Your pictures are very similar to what we saw, which was my 1st time in that kind of rugged terrain with the snow capped mountains and cool temps. It was totally awesome and we all came back refreshed and energized. I hope you can keep having these outdoor experiences, its good for the soul. BTW, Janine and family had a nice short visit with Cathy when they were in D.C. recently too.

On the 14th we drove out to Miles End Lodge in Kingston in central NV for a two night stay. We brought the side by side and dirt bikes. Our friends Alice and Chuck and Steve and their friend Gary were out there too with dirt bikes for the guys. So Alice and I had fun taking turns driving the side by side up Kingston Canyon and down the other side. We had some fun water crossings.\nWe loved seeing everything so green after the abundant snow year.\nAndy and Stan accompanied us on dirt bikes.\nI love that place so much that we will be back in two weeks.\nThen we left the next day in our motorhome for a trip to Portland, Oregon to visit my sister Catherine and her family. Andy and his cousin Sam would be taking a sailing class on the Wiillamate River. It was two days of long drives with beautiful views of snow covered volcanoes, including Mt.

She may be my birth mother\u2013or first mother if you like that term better, although in my mind it doesn\u2019t fit my circumstance\u2013but in the eyes of the law there is no connection between the two of us.\nI won\u2019t, of course, do anything about the funds in the bank account.\nI am still considering having a marker put on her grave though.

You are finding ways to heal what you can, and you are helping others do the same.\nIt sure is interesting, Denise. So many aspects of my adoption story could be described that way. The thing is, I don\u2019t believe in coincidence, I think everything happens for a reason. I usually don\u2019t understand the reasons, but try to trust that all will work out the way it\u2019s intended. The biggest blessing in all of this is hearing from readers who have found a measure of peace and healing in reading my story.\nWhat an interesting and unexpected turn of events! One never knows.\nI can\u2019t help thinking that maybe you learned of this money for a reason. After a certain period of time, I believe unclaimed accounts are turned over to the state. Could you not attempt to claim it, and then donate to a worthy adoption-related cause?\nThanks for stopping by, Cyndia. I don\u2019t know what the laws are in Canada where the account is but I suspect there would have to be some kind of proof required of being a relative of the deceased. There are family members other than myself too. It seems right to me to let this be though I do wonder at the serendipity of learning about this!\nCould it be that not all ties were severed?\nLegal ties were severed.

", "full_output": "I received an email recently from a woman who stumbled across A Slice of Life Writing while doing research about adoption and birth mothers. Through a chain of events she discovered, and subsequently informed me, of a modest sum of money in a bank account that had belonged to my birth mother.\nYou hear about these things sometimes\u2013where someone dies, no one knows about a bank account they had, and the funds sit there unless a family member discovers the account and claims the money.\nHaving read a recent post where I talked about searching for my birth mother\u2019s unmarked grave, and the consideration I was giving to purchasing a marker, this individual suggested that perhaps the funds could be used for just that purpose.\nSounds like a good idea, doesn\u2019t it?\nThe problem, I realized immediately, is that even if I thought it was a good idea to attempt to claim these funds that belonged to my birth mother it\u2019s extremely unlikely I would be able to do so given that I was adopted.\nThe woman who gave birth to me chose to sever her ties with me when I was born. She may be my birth mother\u2013or first mother if you like that term better, although in my mind it doesn\u2019t fit my circumstance\u2013but in the eyes of the law there is no connection between the two of us.\nI won\u2019t, of course, do anything about the funds in the bank account.\nI am still considering having a marker put on her grave though.

The term torrent is used to indicate the downloading file itself.

Once all the pieces of the file have been received by the torrent program, they are assembled into a file that can be used. For assembling purposes, instructions given in the original torrent file are used.\nLarge network servers that are called trackers have the responsibility of carrying out the download.

Logs of the share ratio are also kept by trackers i.e. how much the user\u2019s computer can upload compared to how much it can download. Based on this ratio, the trackers calculate the amount of bandwidth received by the users.\nA fair share policy is incorporated by nearly all torrent trackers. This either grants access or restricts it to bonus bandwidth. According to these fair share policies, a user will be receiving less bandwidth, if they aren\u2019t seeding as much as they are downloading i.e. leeching. If people have a high seeding to leeching ratio, they will be able to download files at a quicker speed in comparison to someone with a low ratio of seeding to leeching.

This means that they can connect quickly to other users on the same server.\nThe primary principle behind BitTorrent is that no matter what corner of the world an individual is in, they can be the server of files and also the client and can make the file available for copying purposes. A torrent file will be easier to download if it has more copies in the system. The culture of torrent downloading has become popular all over the world. There are a number of torrent clients, which are being used by people for downloading various files. Some of these clients include uTorrent, which is an open source and lightweight client. There is also BitTorrent, the original torrent software client. BitTornado, Deluge, Transmission and Torrentus are some others that can be used.\n\nA numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing: 1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

No need for anything else.\nOf course the fact that CDs cost 20 times more than what they cost to produce also played a role in this decision.\nAnyway, this all changed this afternoon for me as I was at Omocha Souko, the cathedral of crap that I love so. They had put out crate upon crate of used CDs at the exact right price point with which to coaxe me out of my self-imposed CD-purchasing exile: 10 yen (10 cents) each.\nSeeing these crates really brought me back. It was 1996 again. An Ottawa winter. I had my geeky big-frame glasses and army haircut back. Flannel shirt and blue jeans. Wait, some of that stuff describes how I still look. Anyway, it brought me back. I used to love scouring used CD bins for good albums back then.\nAnd I would again today: the day of the used CD sale.\nIt kind of brought a sentimental tear to my eye to see all these lovelies together again after such a long absence from my life.\nIt feels a bit different now than it did in the 90s though. Not a soul was to be seen expressing the slightest interest in them even at the price of 10 yen in the whole hour I spent there. If used CDs had existed during the golden age of Athens, their stories would undoubtedly have provided the classic playwrights with ample fodder for their epic tragedies . Euripides might have done something imaginative with them.\nThe ephemeral nature of success. Hubris. Parachute pants. Its all there.\nNote the dance compilation album in there, second row far right. Oh how times have changed.\nOr not. On popping it in for a listen I discover it to be just awful. Aural pain. I may actually bring it back to the store and just toss it back into the bin.\nOtherwise though, some relatively safe selections. There is an album of Japanese punk bands torturing out a tribute to Nirvana's catalogue in there. It is either trash or the greatest thing I have ever purchased. I can't decide.\nPat Benatar is serenading me as I type this. The sun sets on a cold Fukuoka December afternoon and all is well with the world again.\nNever heard of them, but the title of the single is \"Kokudo Nigosen\", the name of an old 2 lane highway running through the Kansai region that, coincidentally, I used to live on from 1999-2000.\nIts a punk album. They know 2 chords. 2 more than I know, at least. Not much of a voice on the singer though.\n10 cents may indeed be a bit overpriced for a 'Live' album.\n1996 was a lovely year wasn't it? Remember how much I used to know about Pearl Jam back then? Lovely year, that.\nI intend to go back to that CD sale today on the hunt for a Neil Diamond album should they have one.

If three sharks are born at once, usually only one of those three will survive to adulthood. There are predators that think small sharks are tasty.

The three-day protest, which started on 30 March 2016, ended violently when state security forces opened fire at the protesters.\nThe incident left two persons dead, at least 37 hurt and wounded. Many are still unaccounted for after the violent dispersal, including women, elderly and six minors. At least 45 men were illegally arrested and are now under police custody at the Kidapawan Gym, while 27 women (three are pregnant and two senior citizens) are at the Kidapawan City Convention Center.\nThe rest of the protesters who are in sanctuary at the Spottswood Methodist Center of the United Methodist Church (UMC) continue to experience harassment, as combined elements of the police and military surround the church compound and restrict the entry and exit of farmers, their supporters, and church-goers.\nThe farmers mounted the protest to call the government\u2019s attention to the much needed distribution of relief goods and agricultural assistance amid the impact of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon. However, government action is stuck on issuing warnings against the severe effects of El Ni\u00f1o especially among farmers and the issuance of press releases on billions of pesos allocated to mitigate the situation. Nothing followed.\nLet us call for the immediate release of drought assistance, pull out the police and military from the UMC grounds and vicinity, stop the continuing harassment and intimidation, as well as arrests and threat of arrests against the protesters. Join us in our call to hold Pres. Benigno Aquino III, Department of Agriculture Sec. Proceso Alcala, North Cotabato Governor Emmylou Tali\u00f1o-Mendoza, and P/Supt. Alexander Tagum accountable for the violent dispersal. As we stand with the farmers, we call for justice for all the victims of government\u2019s criminal negligence and state fascism.\nOn 30 March 2016, at around 6 a.m., some 6,000 farmers from different towns of North Cotabato staged a barricade along the Davao-Cotabato highway in Kidapawan City, in front of the Spottswood Methodist Center. The farmers were from several municipalities of North Cotabato such as Makilala, Mlang, Tulunan, Magpet, Roxas, Antipas, Arakan and Kidapawan. They demanded for: 1.) the release of 15,000 sacks of rice as calamity assistance; 2.) subsidy of rice, seedlings, fertilizers, and pesticides until the drought ends; 3.) increase of farmgate prices of agricultural products; and 4.) the pullout of military troops in their communities.\nOn the same day, 20 elements of the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team arrived with the Philippine National Police-Special Action Forces (PNP-SAF). Police Inspector Calinga, Chief of Police in Kidapawan, P/Supt. Alexander Tagum, Director of North Cotabao provincial PNP, and Col. Badian, Director of Police Region 12 were also at the rally site. The farmers refused to negotiate without the presence of North Cotabato Governor Emmylou \u201cLala\u201d Tali\u00f1o-Mendoza. The farmers have directly addressed their demands to the governor.\nLate in the afternoon, Governor Mendoza sent word that she will only speak to the leaders of the protest and would only do so in the City Hall. Leaders refused, fearing possible arrest and also because they wanted the governor to see the protesters at the barricade.\nOn March 31, as early as 1:30 a.m., sleeping protesters were awakened by loud announcements from the police who repeatedly told them to go home. The police even claimed that the rice support was already sent to their respective municipalities. The announcements were temporarily stopped at around 5 a.m. and then resumed after an hour. This time, the police threatened the protesters with mass arrest.\nThroughout the day, there were several attempts by the police to harass the farmers. Some farmers were violently grabbed from the barricade ranks while others were forced to ride the trucks and brought to the police precinct.\nAttempts at negotiations resumed even as Governor Tali\u00f1o-Mendoza refused to face the farmers. The protesters reiterated their call for the release of 15,000 sacks of rice as drought assistance. Gov. Mendoza rejected this, saying that three kilos of rice will be distributed on a quarterly basis. Negotiations remained unsuccessful. By evening, reports came in that the barricade would be dispersed.\nOn the morning of April 1, protesters received a call from Gov. Mendoza saying she was open to talk with the protesters but only after her press conference at 10 a.m. At around 10:30 a.m., however, Mayor Joseph Evangelista and P/Supt. Tagum arrived, asking to speak to the leaders of the barricade. Minutes later, P/Supt. Tagum ordered the police to gear up, saying the barricade will be dispersed in five seconds. Negotiating team on the side of the protesters tried to appeal but to no avail.\nThe violent dispersal started. The police advanced and broke up the protesters\u2019 line, hit them with truncheons, threw stones at the protesters and blasted water cannons mounted on fire trucks. Some were beaten up. The protesters retreated and started throwing stones at the policemen. The police responded by firing shots directed at the people in the barricade. Protesters ran away; some took shelter at UMC. Police continued to fire as protesters ran for safety.\nAccording to Solidarity Action Group for Indigenous People and Peasants (SAGIPP), two died of gunshot wounds\u2014Enrico Fabligar and Darwin Sulang. Enrico Fabligar was a resident living near the rally site and was not among the protesters. Victor Lumandang, earlier reported killed, is in the Midway Hospital-Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and in critical condition. Rotello Daelto, who was also reported killed, is now in San Pedro Medical Center in Davao City. Daelto has gunshot wounds in the face and legs.\nAt least 37 were hurt and wounded and many are still unaccounted for, including women, elderly and six minors. At least 45 men were illegally arrested and are in the custody of the police in the Kidapawan Gym, while 27 women (three pregnant and two senior citizens) were arrested and detained at the Kidapawan City Convention Center.\nAfter the violent dispersal, the protesting farmers sought sanctuary at the UMC compound in Kidapawan. They were cordoned off by some 200 members of the PNP and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). At around 5 p.m., support groups arrived in the UMC compound to give aid to protesters. They were allowed to enter the compound but not without having their bags searched and their names listed down on a logbook. The police and military had set up camp at the entrance of the UMC compound.\nBy 6:20 p.m., the police and military prevented some 20 people from going out of the UMC. The group was tasked to search for the missing persons. A certain Inspector Maginiw, who identified himself as the ground commander, insisted that no one can leave without having their identities confirmed in the list of names. A PNP officer took photos while the group and the police negotiated.\nAt 8:40 p.m., the lights went out inside the UMC compound even as lights in the residential dwellings and streetlamps remained lit. At 10 p.m., protesters received a report that P/Supt. Alexander Tagum has produced a search warrant for the UMC.\nOn April 2, harassment continued. At 6:25 a.m., police officers Col. Tuzon and Col. Ajero of the Cotabato Provincial Police Office, along with Major Sumugat, arrived to serve a search warrant. The warrant was applied for by P/Supt. Alexander Tagum, citing the presence of firearms inside the UMC compound. The police searched the seven structures inside the compound, but aside from a police cap and a pouch, nothing else was found. As of this posting, police and military elements continue to loiter around the UMC compound, restricting the entry of food, medical supplies, and other resources.\nThe authorities have blamed the victims, questioned permits, blamed militant groups, threatened farmers of arrest, even accused protesters of having firearms, awarded medals to the police officers who conducted the violent dispersal; they have done everything except address the fundamental problem which brought the farmers to the barricade. We can only wait for what fictional tale they will tell next.\nOn 20 January 2016, the province of North Cotabato has been placed under a state of calamity due to the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon. In 2015, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services (PAGASA) released statements that the dry spell is expected to reduce rainfall by 60 to 80 percent, affecting more than half of the country. It was expected to be one of the strongest in the last decades, predicted to endanger livelihoods, harvests and nutritional status of rural poor households in the agricultural sector.\nIn North Cotabato, agricultural losses have reached PhP1 billion due to drought, affecting the towns of Alamada, Pigcawayan, Kabacan, Matalam, Aleosan, Mlang, Magpet, Pikit, Tulunan, Carmen, and Kidapawan. In Kidapawan, the damage to crops has already amounted to more than P30 million, affecting 11,000 families, according to the City Social Welfare and Development Office. Given this, the city government was set to use its calamity fund to aid farmers affected by the drought, promising 15,000 sacks of rice.\nOn December 2015, the Department of Budget Management announced a PhP19.2 billion fund allotted to aid El Ni\u00f1o affected communities. Government plans included cloud seeding operations, distribution of early maturing rice varieties and heat-resistant crops, and maximizing crop production in regions and provinces not severely affected by drought. However, reports indicate that the funds have yet to be disbursed by the national government. Local disaster executives admitted that the cloud seeding operations have not been successful. The P4 million initiated by the Department of Agriculture for cloud seeding have produced little rain. Other calamity assistance has yet to be released.\n7.

The farmers were from several municipalities of North Cotabato such as Makilala, Mlang, Tulunan, Magpet, Roxas, Antipas, Arakan and Kidapawan. They demanded for: 1.) the release of 15,000 sacks of rice as calamity assistance; 2.) subsidy of rice, seedlings, fertilizers, and pesticides until the drought ends; 3.) increase of farmgate prices of agricultural products; and 4.) the pullout of military troops in their communities.\nOn the same day, 20 elements of the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team arrived with the Philippine National Police-Special Action Forces (PNP-SAF). Police Inspector Calinga, Chief of Police in Kidapawan, P/Supt. Alexander Tagum, Director of North Cotabao provincial PNP, and Col. Badian, Director of Police Region 12 were also at the rally site. The farmers refused to negotiate without the presence of North Cotabato Governor Emmylou \u201cLala\u201d Tali\u00f1o-Mendoza. The farmers have directly addressed their demands to the governor.\nLate in the afternoon, Governor Mendoza sent word that she will only speak to the leaders of the protest and would only do so in the City Hall. Leaders refused, fearing possible arrest and also because they wanted the governor to see the protesters at the barricade.\nOn March 31, as early as 1:30 a.m., sleeping protesters were awakened by loud announcements from the police who repeatedly told them to go home. The police even claimed that the rice support was already sent to their respective municipalities. The announcements were temporarily stopped at around 5 a.m. and then resumed after an hour. This time, the police threatened the protesters with mass arrest.\nThroughout the day, there were several attempts by the police to harass the farmers. Some farmers were violently grabbed from the barricade ranks while others were forced to ride the trucks and brought to the police precinct.\nAttempts at negotiations resumed even as Governor Tali\u00f1o-Mendoza refused to face the farmers. The protesters reiterated their call for the release of 15,000 sacks of rice as drought assistance. Gov. Mendoza rejected this, saying that three kilos of rice will be distributed on a quarterly basis. Negotiations remained unsuccessful. By evening, reports came in that the barricade would be dispersed.\nOn the morning of April 1, protesters received a call from Gov. Mendoza saying she was open to talk with the protesters but only after her press conference at 10 a.m. At around 10:30 a.m., however, Mayor Joseph Evangelista and P/Supt. Tagum arrived, asking to speak to the leaders of the barricade. Minutes later, P/Supt. Tagum ordered the police to gear up, saying the barricade will be dispersed in five seconds. Negotiating team on the side of the protesters tried to appeal but to no avail.\nThe violent dispersal started. The police advanced and broke up the protesters\u2019 line, hit them with truncheons, threw stones at the protesters and blasted water cannons mounted on fire trucks. Some were beaten up. The protesters retreated and started throwing stones at the policemen. The police responded by firing shots directed at the people in the barricade. Protesters ran away; some took shelter at UMC. Police continued to fire as protesters ran for safety.\nAccording to Solidarity Action Group for Indigenous People and Peasants (SAGIPP), two died of gunshot wounds\u2014Enrico Fabligar and Darwin Sulang. Enrico Fabligar was a resident living near the rally site and was not among the protesters. Victor Lumandang, earlier reported killed, is in the Midway Hospital-Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and in critical condition. Rotello Daelto, who was also reported killed, is now in San Pedro Medical Center in Davao City. Daelto has gunshot wounds in the face and legs.\nAt least 37 were hurt and wounded and many are still unaccounted for, including women, elderly and six minors. At least 45 men were illegally arrested and are in the custody of the police in the Kidapawan Gym, while 27 women (three pregnant and two senior citizens) were arrested and detained at the Kidapawan City Convention Center.\nAfter the violent dispersal, the protesting farmers sought sanctuary at the UMC compound in Kidapawan. They were cordoned off by some 200 members of the PNP and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). At around 5 p.m., support groups arrived in the UMC compound to give aid to protesters. They were allowed to enter the compound but not without having their bags searched and their names listed down on a logbook. The police and military had set up camp at the entrance of the UMC compound.\nBy 6:20 p.m., the police and military prevented some 20 people from going out of the UMC. The group was tasked to search for the missing persons. A certain Inspector Maginiw, who identified himself as the ground commander, insisted that no one can leave without having their identities confirmed in the list of names. A PNP officer took photos while the group and the police negotiated.\nAt 8:40 p.m., the lights went out inside the UMC compound even as lights in the residential dwellings and streetlamps remained lit. At 10 p.m., protesters received a report that P/Supt. Alexander Tagum has produced a search warrant for the UMC.\nOn April 2, harassment continued. At 6:25 a.m., police officers Col. Tuzon and Col. Ajero of the Cotabato Provincial Police Office, along with Major Sumugat, arrived to serve a search warrant. The warrant was applied for by P/Supt. Alexander Tagum, citing the presence of firearms inside the UMC compound. The police searched the seven structures inside the compound, but aside from a police cap and a pouch, nothing else was found. As of this posting, police and military elements continue to loiter around the UMC compound, restricting the entry of food, medical supplies, and other resources.\nThe authorities have blamed the victims, questioned permits, blamed militant groups, threatened farmers of arrest, even accused protesters of having firearms, awarded medals to the police officers who conducted the violent dispersal; they have done everything except address the fundamental problem which brought the farmers to the barricade. We can only wait for what fictional tale they will tell next.\nOn 20 January 2016, the province of North Cotabato has been placed under a state of calamity due to the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon. In 2015, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services (PAGASA) released statements that the dry spell is expected to reduce rainfall by 60 to 80 percent, affecting more than half of the country. It was expected to be one of the strongest in the last decades, predicted to endanger livelihoods, harvests and nutritional status of rural poor households in the agricultural sector.\nIn North Cotabato, agricultural losses have reached PhP1 billion due to drought, affecting the towns of Alamada, Pigcawayan, Kabacan, Matalam, Aleosan, Mlang, Magpet, Pikit, Tulunan, Carmen, and Kidapawan. In Kidapawan, the damage to crops has already amounted to more than P30 million, affecting 11,000 families, according to the City Social Welfare and Development Office. Given this, the city government was set to use its calamity fund to aid farmers affected by the drought, promising 15,000 sacks of rice.\nOn December 2015, the Department of Budget Management announced a PhP19.2 billion fund allotted to aid El Ni\u00f1o affected communities. Government plans included cloud seeding operations, distribution of early maturing rice varieties and heat-resistant crops, and maximizing crop production in regions and provinces not severely affected by drought. However, reports indicate that the funds have yet to be disbursed by the national government. Local disaster executives admitted that the cloud seeding operations have not been successful. The P4 million initiated by the Department of Agriculture for cloud seeding have produced little rain. Other calamity assistance has yet to be released.\n7.

Every single one of them was okay with fraudulently achieving their police status through conspiracy and cheating.\nAfter snitching on fellow classmates, an investigation was launched and the true scope of the cheating scandal was discovered.\nWith troopers like these, however, the public is likely better served without them on the force. Nevertheless, before they were all fired, the troopers were placed in 52 assignments across the state and began carrying out their duties of extorting drivers for speeding.\nAccording to the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, the group had written a total of 133 speeding tickets since they graduated. McDonough said that information has been supplied to courts across the state, with the expectation that most of those violations will be dismissed.\nInsanely enough, this is the second time in only a few weeks TFTP has reported on an entire class of cops being fired. As we reported earlier this month, 37 future employees of the West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation all raised their right arm in a Nazi salute and documented it with a photo. The incident, which goes far beyond just poor taste, subsequently became the subject of an investigation and multiple employees were suspended after the photo came to light.

In Kentucky, a licensed cosmetologist is required to undergo twice as much training as a state trooper.\nLowering the bar should come as no surprise given the fact that a federal court ruled police departments across the nation can discriminate against applicants who are too smart.\nIt takes a special kind of person to go to work every day and harass, kidnap, and kill people for victimless crimes. The act of unquestioningly carrying out orders to ruin the lives of good people whose only \u201ccrime\u201d was to do with their own body as they wish, would eventually have to raise the eyebrow of a person with a higher level of intelligence\u2026or so we\u2019d like to think.\nKnowing that this ability to discriminate against intelligence in police departments exists coupled with the lowering of the academic bar tends to put \u2018Police State USA\u2019 in perspective.

", "full_output": "Atlanta, GA \u2014 Dozens of cops in Georgia are tarnishing the badge once more after they were all fired this week. According to reports, 30 troopers with the Georgia State Patrol are now unemployed because they were found to have cheated on the test to become cops.\nHardly an \u201cisolated incident,\u201d Col. Mark McDonough, commissioner of the Department of Public Safety and head of GSP, said the entire class of students with the 106th trooper school is no longer after they cheated during an online test for speed detection in October of 2019.\nLet that sink in. The entire class conspired to cheat on exams to become cops. Every single one of them was okay with fraudulently achieving their police status through conspiracy and cheating.\nAfter snitching on fellow classmates, an investigation was launched and the true scope of the cheating scandal was discovered.\nWith troopers like these, however, the public is likely better served without them on the force. Nevertheless, before they were all fired, the troopers were placed in 52 assignments across the state and began carrying out their duties of extorting drivers for speeding.\nAccording to the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, the group had written a total of 133 speeding tickets since they graduated. McDonough said that information has been supplied to courts across the state, with the expectation that most of those violations will be dismissed.\nInsanely enough, this is the second time in only a few weeks TFTP has reported on an entire class of cops being fired. As we reported earlier this month, 37 future employees of the West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation all raised their right arm in a Nazi salute and documented it with a photo. The incident, which goes far beyond just poor taste, subsequently became the subject of an investigation and multiple employees were suspended after the photo came to light. Then, in the only move that would have been acceptable, everyone involved with taking the photo and posing in it has been fired. So much for the bad apple excuse.\nAs Georgia now struggles to replace the spots previously filled by the corrupt troopers, they may have to turn to tactics like their neighbors in Kentucky. As TFTP previously reported, for many years, the bar was set pretty high for the state\u2019s police force, which included the equivalent of two years of college and two years of experience as a member of the armed forces or police force. But in 2017, the KY state police announced they are taking applicants who hold a high school diploma, a GED, and three years of experience as a soldier or a cop.\nThis doesn\u2019t represent a lowering of standards. New recruits will still undergo the same rigorous 24-week training regime, take the same tests and be subject to the same background check as they always have been. The difference now is that a wider variety of people can join the force.\n\u201cAll we\u2019re doing is widening the opportunity for people who maybe didn\u2019t have the chance to go to college\u2026We\u2019re really opening a door for them to be able to fulfill their dream of coming on,\u201d Loudermilk said.\nCoincidentally, as the Free Thought Project has pointed out in the past, the training requirements for hairdressers are oftentimes two or three-fold longer and more rigorous than training for police.

Maybe you\u2019ll talk \u2013 carefully \u2013 with parents of other kids with the same condition. Maybe you even have the condition. Maybe their teachers know \u2013 but they\u2019ll never say anything to you. You wanted your kids to be normal, to fit in, to not face the same issues you did. You\u2019ve seen these kids before and maybe felt sorry for them. On TV, they are often outcasts. And now you know that your kids have this diagnosis. But do you tell them??? Someone said it would ruin their mindset!\nNerd. Brainiac. Quirky. Unique. Gifted.\nSo, you\u2019ve discovered your child is gifted. He started reading at three. Your four year old daughter has the vocabulary of a teenager (thankfully without the cursing). Your five year old watches Neil deGrasse Tyson \u2013 and understands him. Your first grader\u2019s math worksheets are beyond the end of the year. Your third grader scores higher than 75% of eighth graders on the ACT Explore test. This is great!\nYour son sounds like a professor and the other kids don\u2019t like it. Your daughter just \u2026 won\u2019t \u2026 stop asking questions. The tags on his clothes and any weird smell or flashing light deeply bother him. Her mind is racing all night long and she can\u2019t sleep. He reads a book about cancer and becomes obsessed with it, freaking out that someone he might know is going to die from it. She doesn\u2019t fit in with her classmates. He\u2019s stuck at a reading table all by himself. And those quirks drive you absolutely nuts! This is not great.\nYou know your child is different. But do you tell her?\nSome would say no. They will say that \u2018gifted\u2019 is elitist and leads the child to believe they are better than others. Some will say that every child is gifted, so it shouldn\u2019t apply to just a few. Some will say that it creates a Fixed Mindset instead of encouraging a Growth Mindset. Some would say that we shouldn\u2019t categorize kids.\nI believe it is important to tell your children.\nYour gifted child is not better than others. Having superior skills \u2013 in academics, sports, music, or other areas \u2013 does not make someone a better person. Despite our society\u2019s shift towards a utilitarian society where people are valued or degraded based on their skills, health, and what they can contribute, it is important to teach our children that every person has worth, deserves respect and good treatment, and is valued for their humanity. Simply because someone is blessed in one area doesn\u2019t make them more deserving. Being gifted is not a reason to be elevated, but an opportunity to help others more. Your child may be accorded honors that often go to those who are very intelligent or creative, but you have an opportunity while they are young to form their views of equality and humility.\nA recent trend in education is the Growth Mindset. Some say it is dangerous to tell a child he is smart or gifted and instead we should praise effort. That advice is very damaging for the unchallenged gifted student in today\u2019s classrooms. Many times this student is succeeding on innate intelligence alone and expending very little effort. Praising this child for effort is lying to him. If we are praising the vast amount of effort when little is given, what will this student do when vast effort is required? If everything is accomplished through effort, does this mean his classmates are lazy? Be honest with your child that some things will come easy to her and require little effort, but it is important to work hard anyway. Then ask his teacher to provide a curriculum that will challenge him to expend effort and help him grow. And put your child in music lessons where effort and talent together create success.\nSome don\u2019t like categories and see words like \u2018gifted\u2019, \u2018black\u2019, or \u2018low income\u2019 as divisive. However, your children will be categorized. You can explain to them the unique qualities of being gifted or wait until other kids tease them with \u2018nerd\u2019 and \u2018brainiac\u2019. Provide your children with an understanding of their traits to fall back on. Categories also drive education funding and services. If there is funding available for a classification of students, they will need to be identified for that category to receive services. There are good reasons to eschew categorization, but giftedness will be part of your child\u2019s identity whether you name it or not.\nSo don\u2019t keep giftedness a secret from your kids. As they \u2013 and you \u2013 struggle to understand their identity, this little bit of information can be enlightening.\nThank you for reading Rochester SAGE.

Reasons to migrate could be natural and hunger crisis, economic strain, religious expansion movements, forced slavery or persecution. Refugees and migrants carried with them traditions, experience, ideas and knowledge.\nImmigrant communities circulate socio-cultural notions and contribute to city expansion, diversity and attractiveness in fields such as art, tourism, gastronomy, and economy. They further situate cities as interactive global zones in international relations. Throughout centuries, the Euro-Mediterranean zone has been characterized by mobility, circularity and transboundary economic, ideational and cultural processes. As such, it represents an ideal contact zone for studying the beneficial aspects of migration. With this in mind, policy makers could take on refugee crises as an opportunity rather than a liability.\nWHAT ARE LINKAGES BETWEEN MIGRATION, POLITICAL ACTIVISM AND REBELLION?\nThroughout history, many have emigrated as a result of oppression. Once in exile, they have contributed - through protests, awareness raising, citizen journalism, and lobbying - to crafting a transnational politics of democratization. In the light of the Arab uprisings, diasporic communities have established grassroot initiatives, attracted attention to the plight of ordinary citizens, and raised awareness on the longstanding popular grievances.\nVivid scholarly discourses on rebellion and resistance against unjust ruler-ship existed in Medieval Latin\u2013Christian as well as the Arabic-Islamic world. Christian medieval scholars focused on the question of legal resistance against tyranny. Islamic discourses on rebellion were advanced by legal experts of different law schools who concentrated on the evaluation of \u2018legal\u2019 reasons to resist.

With the Cameleon3, you get the chassis, seat and carrycot for RRP \u00a3869. This makes the Dutch-made buggy one of the most expensive pushchairs on the market and it\u2019s often seen in the hands of celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, Sienna Miller and James Corden.\nFor a similar Oyster 2 package with chassis, seat and carrycot, you\u2019ll pay \u00a3488, plus an extra \u00a320 if you want to colour-coordinate your carrycot. This good value price tag is one of the reasons why the Oyster has become such a popular model.\nWhich buggy is best to push?\nBoth buggies are at home in the city. They\u2019re comfortable and easy to push on flat surfaces, plus they feel responsive when steering in tight spaces. However, Oyster 2 users tend to feel the ride isn\u2019t particularly smooth and the suspension is rather lacking. No such complaints from Cameleon3 parents.\nThe Cameleon3 also has a bit of wow factor when it comes to versatility.\nFirstly, by switching the parent handle over, you can have either the small swivel wheels at the front or the larger foam-filled 12\u201d wheels at the front. The swivel wheels are essential for urban pushing, whereas you need the big wheels at the front for uneven ground.\nSecondly, there\u2019s a two-wheel mode (pictured above) which means you can pull the buggy on just two wheels (a bit like a wheelbarrow) over more extreme terrain, such as sand or snow. Perfect if you\u2019re a jet-setting parent who likes to take your buggy on the beach or slopes. If you\u2019re not, then you might think it\u2019s more of a cool (and slightly fiddly to achieve) gimmick.\nOur reviewer found the Oyster 2, meanwhile, is not so comfortable on uneven ground. She described her experience of pushing her Oyster 2 over bumpy streets and cobbled roads as a \u201cbit of a bone rattling experience\u201d.\nEase of folding is where these buggies score lower marks. Neither have quick and easy folding mechanisms.\nThe Cameleon3 has to be taken apart into two pieces before it can be folded. The carrycot or car seat is taken off first and then the chassis folded down after. Although the chassis fold claims to be one-handed (an improvement on earlier models) having to dismantle the buggy pre-folding needs two hands.The BabyStyle Oyster 2 folds with the seat in place in both forward-facing and rear-facing positions. But it\u2019s fiddly at first and took a fair amount of practice before it became easier. The main difficulty with folding the Oyster is that you have to remove the bumper bar and apron to fold it when in the forward-facing position, which can be a major inconvenience. It\u2019s also possible to remove the seat from the chassis and fold them both separately.\nAfter a travel system? Check out our 10 of the best travel systems for less than \u00a3400.\nOur reviewer found that the Oyster 2 folded into different sizes, depending on which way the seat was facing. Forward facing gives a smaller, but bulky fold. Parent facing gives a slimmer but taller fold. Neither were described as compact. The main complaint from Cameleon3 users is that you can\u2019t hook the two folded pushchair components together, so it\u2019s not easy to carry around.\nWhere the Oyster 2 does much better than the Cameleon3 is on storage space. The underseat basket can hold up to 20 litres and coped well with the multitude of bags our tester put in it. No matter the position of the seat unit on the chassis, the basket remains easily accessible. However, when you use the carrycot, the basket is not so easy to reach.\nWhile Bugaboo boasts that its buggy can hold up to 24 litres, we found it to be fiddly to get shopping in and out, and almost impossible to reach when the carrycot is in place.\nAs we know age and size can vary significantly between children, which is why most companies use the word \u2018approximately\u2019 when highlighting a products age range. The Oyster 2 has the normal recommendation of being suitable for children up to 15kg (approx 3 years). However, the Cameleon3 has higher than normal upper age limit of 17kg (approx 4 years).\nBoth buggies are easy on the eye, but the Cameleon3 does boast an iconic design, which has since been much copied. Both offer chassis that come in either stylish black matte or en vogue aluminum finish, plus a range of colour options.\nThe Cameleon3 chassis comes in either matt black or aluminium finish and has 7 statement colours, while the Oyster 2 chassis comes in 3 variations: satin black, mirror finish (shiny silver) and anodised (matt) silver and is currently available in 5 eye-catching colours.\nThis is the weight for the chassis, wheels and seat for both buggies. Neither could be termed lightweight, but the Cameleon3 is the clear winner.\nDo you need a stroller? Here are our 10 best buggies for less than \u00a350.\nYes, both buggies are travel system compatible, allowing you to add a Group 0+ car seat for your baby. The Oyster 2 fits the Maxi-Cosi Pebble, Cabriofix and Citi, a Britax Baby-Safe and SHR II, a Be Safe iZi Go, a Cybex Aton 2 and 3 and an Oyster own brand car seat.\nThe Cameleon3 is compatible with a Maxi-Cosi Pebble, Cabriofix and Citi, a Britax Baby-Safe Plus II and SHR II, a Be Safe iZi Go, a Cybex Aton and a Bebe Confort Pebble.\nAdaptors are required for both buggies, but there\u2019s one difference \u2013 the Bugaboo adaptors are more expensive.\nAs far as additional extras go, the Cameleon3 offers an array of pricey accessories, including footmuff, blanket, seat liner, bag, sun canopy cup holder and more. The Oyster 2 has fewer extras, but does offer a smart coordinating changing bag and footmuff. A nice little added extra from BabyStyle is the integral mosquito net, which you don\u2019t need to pay more for. Most importantly, both can be fitted with an attachable buggy board, for toddlers who want to ride on the back. Here again, price is a factor because, at around \u00a360, the Cameleon3 buggy board is almost \u00a320 more expensive than its Oyster 2 counterpart.\nDon\u2019t want to push? See our 10 best carriers.\nWhich is better \u2013 the Cameleon3 or Oyster?\n\nIf you\u2019re after a good value, cool looking, practical buggy, which has good, easy-to-access storage when you\u2019re using the seat (rather than the carrycot), then the BabyStyle Oyster 2 is a great choice.\n* Mamas & Papas Mylo.\n", "prompt": "Bugaboo Cameleon3 vs BabyStyle Oyster 2: Which is best for you?\nLet\u2019s start with the biggest difference.

Here again, price is a factor because, at around \u00a360, the Cameleon3 buggy board is almost \u00a320 more expensive than its Oyster 2 counterpart.\nDon\u2019t want to push? See our 10 best carriers.\nWhich is better \u2013 the Cameleon3 or Oyster?\n\nIf you\u2019re after a good value, cool looking, practical buggy, which has good, easy-to-access storage when you\u2019re using the seat (rather than the carrycot), then the BabyStyle Oyster 2 is a great choice.\n* Mamas & Papas Mylo.\n\nA numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing: 1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

A CD offering with identical contents was originally planned and advertised, but delays in the CD album's approval caused it to be delayed indefinitely.\nBuy it... if you love hearing brute Hans Zimmer hybrid action scores and other related music regurgitated by his Remote Control associates, even if such arrangements border on plagiarism.\nAvoid it... if you expect full development of either the guilty pleasure anthems from the first score in the franchise or the smooth, easy-listening portions of the second, both mostly absent from the album for this incohesive and unsatisfying conclusion to the trilogy.\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon: (Steve Jablonsky) A few constants have come to define the Michael Bay-directed franchise of live-action Tranformers films. First, you still won't visually recognize any of the robots easily if you were a fan of the 1980's show and its associated Hasbro toy line. Secondly, the script won't make a whole lot of sense if you try to compare its arc to that of the original concept, either. Third, footage from prior Bay films will be incorporated for a myriad of reasons. Fourth, revered critics will pound the film with overwhelmingly negative reviews that dismiss the endeavor as juvenile and incomprehensible. Fifth, audiences will flock to the movie anyway, making it a huge box office success domestically and worldwide. Altogether, once the premise was rebooted in 2007, you knew what to expect from its sequels, and nothing about 2011's Transformers: Dark of the Moon will surprise eager audiences. After the substantial script issues with 2009's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, at least Dark of the Moon had a better organized plotline from the start. It opens and closes many doors about the history of the machines and their Cybertron homeworld, though because of Bay's lack of interest in making another sequel in the franchise, many of the major characters are destroyed and the overarching franchise storyline is largely concluded by this entry. These films remain brainless entertainment made incomprehensible by the devastation of the concept's original water-tight mythos and, of course, Bay's often impossible shooting style. It's no surprise that Hans Zimmer spin-off composer Steve Jablonsky has been along for the ride in this trilogy rather than really making much of an impact on its artistic trajectory. He's become the ultimate laid-back yes-man for Bay, even writing generic library music during production for the director to play with and insert into the third film wherever he wished. Fortunately for the composer, the production schedule for Dark of the Moon was far friendlier than on the previous entry, allowing him to ultimately write over two hours of music for the densely-scored film (no additional composers are credited on the release, but they reportedly were employed). Because of Bay's ridiculously choppy style of shooting, Jablonsky mostly disregarded writing a score significantly tailored to synchronization points in the movie, instead simply serving as an ambient pace-setting device.\nBy instruction of the director, Jablonsky also took a darker, weightier approach to Dark of the Moon, leaving behind the prior heroism and comedy in favor of a serious tone that gives electronics an enhanced role over the orchestra. Grittier synthetic effects, distorted electric guitars, and mutilated samples are the prime order of the day this time around, though Jablonsky still believed that an orchestra consisting of only strings and brass was necessary to give the score the clout expected of a blockbuster. An excess of the deepest base pounding possible is evident in Dark of the Moon, Jablonsky even instructing a baritone guitar to strike the lowest, most aggressive note possible for a specific effect. In general, the demeanor of Zimmer's material in The Dark Knight is what results, and fans of the more seasoned composer will hear significant similarities between Dark of the Moon and several of his works. It's not surprising that Jablonsky is once again overshadowed by Linkin Park, whose songs have become the primary musical identities for each film in this franchise as far as mainstream audiences are concerned. That identity this time is \"Iridescent,\" an appropriately somber rock song that is not surprisingly more poignant and original than anything conjured by Jablonsky for Dark of the Moon. The first score in the franchise established a general heroic atmosphere with typical Remote Control-style anthems that appeal heavily to the guilty pleasure senses of younger film score collectors. The second score served as an easy-listening, pseudo-new age album that was about as simplistic as could be imagined, but it did little to impress those same collectors. The third time around, neither the anthems nor the melodramatic vocals are a factor. What you hear referencing these elements in the film is music simply tracked in from the prior movies' recordings, and none of that material is smartly integrated into the new composition. Instead, the collectors will be horrified by how Jablonsky apparently used all his extra writing time on this installment: copying the temp track. It's not the first time the composer has written music that was blatantly informed by prior works; The Island was a potpourri of popular Zimmer music only slightly rearranged. As mentioned before, The Dark Knight was a clear template for Dark of the Moon, though a fair amount of inspiration from Inception can also be heard in the instrumental applications and more brutal action rhythms as well.\nUnfortunately, Jablonsky's approach to Dark of the Moon is so fragmented that there is practically no overarching narrative in the score, each cue handled with a different motific base and no subtlety of foreshadowing or reminiscence adequately developed with what cohesive ideas are presented. There are plenty of references to phrases of the past themes and their associated chord progressions in the score, but no really convincing maturation or sense of resolution. This technique is immediately heard on album in \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" a cue that hints at the franchise's past without actually serving any intelligent emotive purpose. Zimmer fans will be offered a blatant reference to The Last Samurai in \"Sentinel Prime.\" Non-descript suspense ambience in \"Lost Signal\" and \"In Time You'll See\" references Zimmer scores as far back as Crimson Tide, especially in the last minute of the latter cue. A tepid throwback to the style of the original Sam Witwicky theme slows the score to a sudden halt in \"Impress Me,\" the one light-hearted track on the album. In \"We Were Gods Once,\" audiences are treated to the ultimate in the Hans Zimmer/Remote Control handbook of impressing testosterone-overflowing directors: massively deep brass whole notes. This technique extends into \"Battle,\" which applies these overemphasized notes in a juvenile minor-key series of crescendos that is most definitely from the Inception mould. Light keyboarding and guitar performances of pieces of the famous \"Arrival to Earth\" and Optimus Prime themes in \"There is No Plan\" is comparatively pleasing though not as satisfying as hoped. The duo of \"We All Work for the Decepticons\" and \"The Fight Will Be Your Own\" is what could be termed \"heroic easy-listening tragedy,\" a musical concept from the Armageddon era. The latter cue introduces the usual Martin Tillmann electric cello performances that define much of the second half of the score and meanders through progressions informed not only by prior anthems in the franchise but also Trevor Rabin's Deep Blue Sea. Concept enthusiasts will adore the return of the deep piano thuds in the bass on each measure. Unfortunately, \"Shockwave's Revenge\" teaches us that Jablonsky most likely copied the massively broad, deep brass whole notes from Zimmer to apply as an identity for the lead villain in this installment, and the brute blasting in that cue has to yield among the dumbest pieces of action music (literally brainless drivel) to ever accompany one of these modern blockbusters.

First, you still won't visually recognize any of the robots easily if you were a fan of the 1980's show and its associated Hasbro toy line. Secondly, the script won't make a whole lot of sense if you try to compare its arc to that of the original concept, either. Third, footage from prior Bay films will be incorporated for a myriad of reasons. Fourth, revered critics will pound the film with overwhelmingly negative reviews that dismiss the endeavor as juvenile and incomprehensible. Fifth, audiences will flock to the movie anyway, making it a huge box office success domestically and worldwide. Altogether, once the premise was rebooted in 2007, you knew what to expect from its sequels, and nothing about 2011's Transformers: Dark of the Moon will surprise eager audiences. After the substantial script issues with 2009's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, at least Dark of the Moon had a better organized plotline from the start. It opens and closes many doors about the history of the machines and their Cybertron homeworld, though because of Bay's lack of interest in making another sequel in the franchise, many of the major characters are destroyed and the overarching franchise storyline is largely concluded by this entry. These films remain brainless entertainment made incomprehensible by the devastation of the concept's original water-tight mythos and, of course, Bay's often impossible shooting style. It's no surprise that Hans Zimmer spin-off composer Steve Jablonsky has been along for the ride in this trilogy rather than really making much of an impact on its artistic trajectory. He's become the ultimate laid-back yes-man for Bay, even writing generic library music during production for the director to play with and insert into the third film wherever he wished. Fortunately for the composer, the production schedule for Dark of the Moon was far friendlier than on the previous entry, allowing him to ultimately write over two hours of music for the densely-scored film (no additional composers are credited on the release, but they reportedly were employed). Because of Bay's ridiculously choppy style of shooting, Jablonsky mostly disregarded writing a score significantly tailored to synchronization points in the movie, instead simply serving as an ambient pace-setting device.\nBy instruction of the director, Jablonsky also took a darker, weightier approach to Dark of the Moon, leaving behind the prior heroism and comedy in favor of a serious tone that gives electronics an enhanced role over the orchestra.

This frequently refers to a specific finance technique of individuals taking care of high consumer financial obligation, normally however not always, paying off their home loan and car lendings in order to move from making payments to having a residence. The amount of money that can be obtained depends upon a number of factors, including the equilibrium of the debt and also the rate of interest. These debts are normally paid off with lower rates of interest, as well as staying clear of late settlement fees as well as charges.\nAmong the main pros of financial obligation consolidation is the reality that a number of the disadvantages associated with settling financial obligations are eliminated. The reality that all of your financial debt is under the exact same company that is now supplying you with reduced month-to-month payments suggests that you will certainly not be lured to skip a repayment as well as wind up with additional monetary problem. You are not likely to have to manage numerous payments any longer, as well as several of them may also be able to be made online.\nFinancial obligation debt consolidation programs are similar to finances, though the term is longer. Because of this, you are still needed to make your monthly payments up until the regards to the new funding program are completed. The period of the financial debt loan consolidation program, likewise known as the \u201crepayment day\u201d, is identified at the time the borrower chooses to make the most of it. If you decide to terminate your program before its conclusion date, you will certainly not owe any type of costs, charges or rate of interest fees on that particular date. Certainly, if you end up still owing cash after the payback date, you will certainly owe additional money due to late fees and other fees.\nPrevious Previous post: Points You Need To Find Out About Prophylactic.\nNext Next post: Why Virtual Private System Had Been So Popular Till Right now?\nA numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing: 1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

", "full_output": "Never Mess With Financial Debt Combination And Right here\u2019s The Reasons Why.\nFinancial obligation consolidation is the act of integrating all financial obligations into one repayment. It is an initiative to reorganize a debtor\u2019s financial debt burden. Financial obligations are obligations of a borrower to another business or a federal government company.

It often forms in colourless chisel-shaped crystals and transmits a very high spiritual frequency. It is named after Danbury, Connecticut where is was first identified in 1839. For me, it carries the energy of a crisp, clear winter sky\u2014 unencumbered by clouds, yet very much ringing with the brisk, cleansing forces of air and wind\u2014the mental faculties of intellect and intuition. Danburite is pure starlight crystallized. It carries the message of innate divine wisdom\u2014that all organic material in the Universe is a manifestation of the same waves of pranic energy\u2014quantum strings\u2014forged in the furnace of the Great Central Sun in the moments before the Big Bang. All material in the Universe originated within an infinitesimal space, and has been expanding ever since in the great Spiral Wheel. Danburite sheds light to remind us of this, bringing its message of love, assisting in the ascension to fifth-dimensional One-ness.\nOn a more personal level, danburite creates room for lightness of being. I feel it is an appropriate crystal for this time of year because of this cleansing ability it lends our consciousness. We often begin bouts of \u201cspring cleaning\u201d in our physical spaces\u2014the home or office\u2014but seldom do most people consider the value in clearing the space of the mind. The mental space uncluttered and intentionally cleansed in this way creates room for expanded awareness and for us to safely embark on further astral work\u2014creating experiences and setting goals in the astral realm as a means of future manifestation. The astral planes are the realms between pure consciousness and physical reality. When we visit this place with our minds, we plant seeds of what can manifest, provided we invest the correct energy on the physical plane to facilitate its manifestation. Danburite allows this expansion to take place. By working with this crystal\u2019s majestic, clear energy, we open the window of the mind and allow mental chatter and clutter to be cleared as if with a refreshing breeze. Eliminating the accumulated debris of the mind, we are able to eradicate that which is unnecessary for future growth.\nWhile the best quality pieces form colourless terminations, danburite is often an opaque white, and frequently tinged with a subtle pink hue. This pink variety of danburite resonates particularly with the heart. It facilitates a protected space of healing from past emotional or spiritual wounds. It emanates the energy of self-love in order to hold the heart space safely and securely. By extension, in its ministry of Cosmic One-ness, it teaches love for all sentient beings.\nIn much the same way as garnet, as I explored in the previous post, links the Heart and Root Chakras, danburite links the Heart and Crown Chakras. Its higher frequency doesn\u2019t imply a better quality, but rather that it works to open channels between the emotional and spiritual bodies more so than between the emotional and physical bodies. It is important to honour the movement of energy in both directions in order to achieve balance and harmony in all aspects of life. Linking the Heart and the Crown is a very important endeavor, as it opens our capacities to receive and transmit love as fully conscious beings. On the Tree of Life this is the pathway between Tiphereth and Kether that takes us from Eros\u2014physical love\u2014to Agape\u2014spiritual love. Danburite facilitates the opening of the Crown Chakra and links us with the Soul Star, a transpersonal energy centre about 12 inches above the head. This is the Fountain of Golden Light that generates the halo\u2014the conduit of Sahasrara\u2014the Thousand-Petalled Lotus. In this way, danburite links us with the angelic realm, connecting us with the Higher Self\u2014what the Theosophists called the Holy Guardian Angel\u2014known in ancient Egypt as the Khu. Danburite also transmits communication with the Star People\u2014the Pleiadians, Sirians, and Arcturians\u2014light beings of higher dimensional realms than our own. These astral relationships are forged to facilitate paradigm shifts as these entities bring to our consciousness insight that we, in the third dimension, don\u2019t usually have accessible to us.\nTo work with danburite and become acquainted with your Holy Guardian Angel, I would like to offer a guided meditation, one I call the Crystal Stair. Create a safe and sacred space for yourself. Turn off your phone, play music if you feel it aids your relaxation, light a white candle\u2014do what you intuitively sense to establish an environment unique for the work you are about to do. Sit in a comfortable position, or lay down, and close your eyes. If seated hold the danburite crystal in the palm of your hand or to your heart. If laying down, place the crystal on your brow. Begin by focusing on your breath\u2014inhale deeply through the nose, allow your abdomen to expand.  Take each breath as a count of one\u2014follow your own rhythm\u2014and repeat to the count of ten. Slowly begin to focus inward and allow any daily ambitions and distractions to fade away. Begin to envision a silver cord rising from the crown of your head, if seated, from your brow if laying. This silver cord is your soul\u2019s connection with cosmic consciousness. If, at any time during this meditation, you feel lost or confused you can return to a waking state via the silver cord\u2014it is your personal connection. Sense your consciousness gently rising from its physical container\u2014beyond your home, rising above your street, your city\u2014through the outer reaches of our atmosphere, look back at the Earth\u2014the Gaian bubble\u2014our mortal home. Allow your consciousness to hold an awareness of the earth\u2019s sacred power\u2014as you look down hold this awareness of family, of ancestry, of evolution. Be aware of your part in this evolution. As you pass through our solar system hold an awareness of our sun\u2019s great power, but also that every star you see ahead of you in the cosmic depths is also a sun. As you enter the sparse reaches past Pluto and Eris, greet the guardian spirits of our solar system\u2014the many bizarre objects of the Kuiper belt\u2014the exoplanets science continues to discover\u2014they traverse the threshold into galactic space. You see our system\u2019s nearest star\u2014Proxima Centauri\u2014as you pass further regions, perceiving the great spiral arms of the Milky Way. Beyond our galaxy you feel yourself shift away from physical, bodily awareness\u2014you become an etheric being of pure consciousness. As you float watching a sea of distant galaxies, the silver cord extends beyond you and transforms into a crystal staircase ascending into a cascade of starlight. The destination ahead is safe and your consciousness is drawn up the stairs and passes through the veil of light\u2014this is a dimensional transition and you sense your awareness permeated by the pure radiance. On the other side of the starlit veil a guide has come to greet you. Take a moment to acknowledge this being and what they have to offer you. What do they look like? How do you interact? Is there a message? A gift? This being escorts you along a path of starlight. You reach a destination and stand facing each other. In this moment you are One. Sense the great light at the centre of all existence, in the core of every star, in the nucleus of every cell, within your heart, and within the being before you. Spend as much time as you like communing with this guide. Know that in this space of higher awareness you possess the ability to allow all concern and worry to fall away\u2014you are safe and looked out for. By reaching beyond the starlit veil you, in effect, swept away unnecessary mental clutter in order to take the next steps into this realm. When you feel the time is right, walk back with them beyond the starlit veil. Thank them for their wisdom and guidance and descend the crystal stairs. Once again becoming aware of physical space, you see the distant galaxies before you and your consciousness begins to return to a bodily state. You follow the silver cord back to your home and sacred space. Become aware of the danburite crystal and know it contains the energy and information of the astral journey on which your consciousness just embarked. Take note of anything you feel is important from this meditation. The guide you encountered is an energetic being\u2014an Invisible\u2014that you can develop a relationship with. Repeat this type of meditation as often as you feel compelled. You can continue to use the danburite crystal as a catalyst for these experiences, or carry it when you wish to remember your astral journey. The crystal will help create an energetic link that you can always employ in order to revisit the Crystal Stair.\n", "prompt": "Danburite is a crystal of intense clarity and high vibration.

", "full_output": "Constructing Gene Regulatory Networks on Clusters of Cell Processors\n\nConstructing genome-wide gene regulatory networks from a large number of gene expression profile measurements is an important problem in systems biology. While several techniques have been developed, none of them is parallel, and they lack the capability to scale to the whole-genome level or incorporate the largest data sets, particularly with rigorous statistical testing. To address this problem, we recently developed a mutual information theory based parallel method for gene network reconstruction. In this paper, we extend this work to a cluster of Cell processors. We use parallelization across multiple Cells, multiple cores within each Cell, and vector units within the cores to develop a high performance implementation that effectively addresses the scaling problem. We present experimental results comparing the Cell implementation with a standard uniprocessor implementation and an implementation on a conventional supercomputer.

Don't you just love Valentine's Day? I know, I know\u2026some of you are probably disillusioned by the idea that this holiday is contrived by the greeting card companies to make billions of dollars off of sappy romantics like D and I\u2026but honestly, with so much bad in the world these days, it's nice to have holiday to remind one another of love, not hate. So, Valentine's Day, I love ya! And to my wonderfully awesome readers out there, I LOVE YOU, TOO! If it wasn't for you guys coming back here day after day, I'd probably close up shop and take up ice curling. Really, though\u2026what a weird Olympic sport concept. Anywho, in lieu of romantic dinner plans and boxes of chocolates, D and I are on our way to Austria to spend this long President's Day weekend exploring Salzburg and Innsbruck (you can follow our adventure via Instagram here)! I told D that my Valentine's gift to him would be me promising NOT to sing the entire Sound of Music musical during our trip\u2026but even I can't make that grand of a promise. The hills will most likely be alive with the sound of my screeching. Nevertheless, we're looking forward to spending some time with good friends and taking in the sights of two of Austria's most notable cities. Get ready, Austria! Team Cot\u00e9's a comin' for ya!\nI hope you all have some romantic plans for your Valentine's Day this year! If not, might I suggest cracking open a nice bottle of wine (a good one!), putting on the Robin Thicke Pandora station, and swaying to some slow jams with that special someone? {{winky face}} If Robin Thicke doesn't get your mojo flowin', I don't know who will. But if that doesn't work, you should spend some time hopping around the Fresh Face Friday Blog Hop and getting to know these two sweet-as-pie bloggers below!\nMeet Kelly...wife, traveler, foodie, and author of A Lovely Life Indeed blog! Kelly is an American expat currently navigating life in Galicia, a tiny costal village in the northwest corner Spain (sounds dreamy!). Over on her blog, you'll find many posts about love & marriage, travel around the New England & Spain, as well as inspirational musings about life and wellness. If you haven't already had the pleasure\u2026take some time and get to know Kelly today!\nWhat started as a class assignment for a study abroad to London, Our Live Are An Open Blog has come to represent so much more for Alex and her husband Matt. While they used to live in Hawaii, Alex and Matt are now enjoying expat life in South Korea! Over on Alex's slice of the world wide web, you can read about her amazing Asia travels, reflections on expat living, and lots of fun flashback posts that help you get to know Alex a bit better. Head on over and give her a warm welcome, y'all!\nHey Casey! My husband and I just recently moved from Texas to Germany this year so your blog is so helpful! A couple of my friends and I went to Salzburg in January (pictures on my blog) and had a blast! We did the Sound of Music tour (so fun!) and it is the cutest little town! You and your husband will have a blast...Happy Valentine's Day!\nHey, I don't quite live in Germany but am just across the border in France (and right beside Switzerland) so it's nice to find your blog! Look forward to reading more. If you are ever in Switzerland, feel free to check out my blog :) Happy Valentine's Day...and Enjoy Austria!\nI'm so jealous. Salzburg is one of my favorite cities in Europe! Enjoy your long weekend exploring. Also...last time I was in Salzburg I found out that it is home of the oldest restaurant in Central Europe.

Finding correlation between the human brain and language models 3. 1. Learning to build large-scale multilingual NLP models with a single shared source of knowledge 2. Multilingual NMT (M2M) model ensembles 3. A new model for multi-task learning based on the ensemble of different NMTs for a given source-target language pair. 4. Training the best BERT-based models 5. Improving the quality of NLP models by using more information 6. Unifying pre-training and transfer learning in Natural Language Processing 7. Natural Language Processing and Machine Translation: A Machine Translation approach is to use a large corpus of sentence pairs and train a model that predicts the probability of each word in each language given the corresponding words in the other language. This technique is very similar to the one used in machine translation, where a neural net is used to translate the input sentence into the output sentence. 8. Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Generation are among the most active fields in AI. In this project we are aiming to design a general framework for NLP tasks including text classification, speech and image recognition. We are interested in building systems that can learn from large data and can apply the same techniques to different tasks. The project will involve developing and benchmarking novel algorithms, implementing efficient hardware implementations and evaluating their performance with real-world datasets. 9. The main objective of this research is to develop an Artificial Intelligence Framework for Natural Language Processing Tasks. The AI Framework will be developed in a modular and scalable way. We will develop a natural language understanding (NLU) engine to provide a structured representation of text. We will then develop a deep-learning-based semantic parsing engine for natural language queries to learn the semantic structure of the queries and derive useful information out of it. 10. Improving the performance of a speech translation system for Arabic and English by using different training methods. The system is based on bidirectional recurrent neural network and attention mechanism for language modelling and training the translation model and evaluation of the model. The evaluation will be performed on data from MUN, an Arabic translation database. 11. A new framework for large scale natural language processing tasks. 12. We propose to construct a large-scale multi-document summarization system, which can be applied to a variety of real-world tasks, including information extraction, information retrieval, and automatic summarization. The proposed system would consist of several modules, such as: (a) a document summarization module which constructs an intermediate representation of an input document by identifying", "completion_only": "1.

There was particular annoyance at the differing approaches taken towards the completion of some schools finals in boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 Gaelic football \u2013 a scenario publicly slammed as \u201csexist\u201d by players from both the Moate and Clonmel camps.\nThe Leinster PPS boys senior \u2018A\u2019 final between St Joseph\u2019s Rochfortbridge and Naas CBS was played a fortnight ago, whereas the body overseeing ladies\u2019 football was unwilling to take a similar stance on its national schools competitions following the recent return of GAA activity with the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.\nThe LGFA declined to comment publicly for that report, but it has now issued a statement outlining why it is unwilling to budge.\n\u201cThe LGFA acknowledges that schools and players across all six competitions were left disappointed when, in unprecedented circumstances, the extremely tough decision was taken in March to cancel the Lidl PPS All-Ireland Championships for 2020,\u201d the association says.\n\u201cThis decision was taken in the best interests of all relevant stakeholders, and in line with Government and Public Health Authority advice, following the onset of Covid-19.\n\u201cThe LGFA is proud of its role in helping to limit the spread of Covid-19 and, at all times, the health and wellbeing of all of our members has been our primary concern, and that will continue to be the case.\n\u201cWe are delighted that club activity has resumed across the country \u2013 and we very much hope that local competitions will be completed, ahead of a planned return to inter-county activities in October,\u201d the statement continues.\n\u201cHowever, it should be noted that the total of 85 confirmed new cases of Covid-19 reported yesterday (Thursday) is the highest daily number since late May, and public health officials are extremely concerned by recent trends.\n\u201cIt is quite clear that Covid-19 remains a very real threat to our members and their families, and we will continue to play our part in the fight against coronavirus.\n\u201cAt present, the clear and prescient advice is that fixtures should be played at local/county level only, before a return to national activity later in the year.\n\u201cCovid-19 and its associated dangers are still very much with us \u2013 and will be for some time.\n\u201cIn the current climate, we cannot, and will not, sanction any fixture that involves participants from separate provinces, and until the inter-county window officially opens.\n\u201cThe LGFA\u2019s stance on the 2020 Lidl All-Ireland Post Primary Schools competitions, and indeed other competitions and initiatives affected, has not changed since it was first communicated in March, and reaffirmed following a recent review.\nLate last week, Moate Community School's senior girls' football team had reached that watershed point hovering halfway between fury and despair.\nA young woman is lobbying the Ladies Football Gaelic Association (LGFA) to allow her and her teammates play in an All-Ireland schools final, saying it was a measure of \"inequality\" that boys had been allowed to play and not girls.\n\nA numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing: 1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

She had graduated from Northern Michigan University with a Masters in Fine Art and had an affinity not just toward Warhol or the great impressionists, but she absolutely loved pottery and stoneware and collected roku pieces from local contemporaries like Ed Risak and had a cherished tea pot from Tim Mather.

She\u2019d walk me around the house where she\u2019d spent years planting and nurturing a huge assortment of perennials and she\u2019d tell me the name of each one and what it would look like at different seasons. They also lovingly fed the birds each day, and loved watching the variety. Recently, she showed me the Michigan Bird Guide she keeps handy in the living room and pointed out that almost all the pages had been dog-eared as they had been fortunate enough to get visits from so many of the different species. Those flowers and the birds just add to the tranquility of their home together, which is why it is completely fitting that her ashes be kept here, side-by-side with the beloved pets they\u2019ve lost over the years, overlooking this lovely garden that gave her so much enjoyment.\nIn the end, it\u2019s the LOVE that Christine brought to the world that will continue to shine on in her absence. I was talking to a friend last night who asked if there was anything she could do. My response was that Christine would have wanted us to go out and do something nice for someone else. Today, the next day, just keep the love going. If we all make a conscious effort to be a little nicer, a little more considerate, and make a little more love in the world, I think that would be the ultimate way to honor her memory. She and Tony gave-up exchanging holiday gifts many years ago, and instead make generous donations to a great number of charities they care about. She would be humbled and honored if any of you who would normally send flowers at a time like this, would instead make a donation in her name to a great charity, whether for local needs or to benefit others in far reaches of the world. A few of her favorites were Best Friends Animal Society and Almost Home Rescue League.\nA small memorial service with family and close friends will be held at their home on a later date \u2013 details yet to come.

Those flowers and the birds just add to the tranquility of their home together, which is why it is completely fitting that her ashes be kept here, side-by-side with the beloved pets they\u2019ve lost over the years, overlooking this lovely garden that gave her so much enjoyment.\nIn the end, it\u2019s the LOVE that Christine brought to the world that will continue to shine on in her absence. I was talking to a friend last night who asked if there was anything she could do. My response was that Christine would have wanted us to go out and do something nice for someone else. Today, the next day, just keep the love going. If we all make a conscious effort to be a little nicer, a little more considerate, and make a little more love in the world, I think that would be the ultimate way to honor her memory. She and Tony gave-up exchanging holiday gifts many years ago, and instead make generous donations to a great number of charities they care about. She would be humbled and honored if any of you who would normally send flowers at a time like this, would instead make a donation in her name to a great charity, whether for local needs or to benefit others in far reaches of the world. A few of her favorites were Best Friends Animal Society and Almost Home Rescue League.\nA small memorial service with family and close friends will be held at their home on a later date \u2013 details yet to come. Christine is survived by her loving and devoted husband, Tony Randhawa, and dear friend and business partner Keith Piccione; her adorable fur babies: Alfie, Chewbacca, Whippit, Tucker and Woodbridge; all of the employees and friends in the Finao family, and her loving friends throughout the world.\nWe will miss her deeply.\nA numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing: 1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

", "full_output": "It is with great love and admiration that we say goodbye to Christine Perry-Burke, who passed peacefully on Friday due to complications with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a battle she\u2019d been waging for the past 6 years. Many of you in the industry know her as a fearless leader (emphasis on the FEARLESS), but more importantly, a generous and caring friend. Her compassion for others and bottomless heart spilled into every interaction and will continue to reverberate over time.\nChristine was a driving force in the photography industry from her start as a photographer, then educator, and finally as Finao\u2019s managing partner. She, along with her devoted husband Tony Randhawa, and her dear friend Keith Piccione founded Finao in partnership with a real vision for change and possibility. She breathed a true life-force into the company and poured her passion and vision into each and every one of us, so that we will carry that torch high and bright in her honor and continue to stand at the forefront as a catalyst for change, and with a true sense of purpose as partners with professional photographers.\nChristine single-handedly changed the way albums are manufactured, sold, and displayed by revolutionizing the look and sales of photo albums from boring black albums to cool contemporary art pieces that are now displayed in homes all around the world. Her vision and unique sense of style will leave a lasting impression on the photo industry for many years to come. I always joked with her that I was going to get a bunch of those rubber bracelets made up that would say WWCD (What Would Christine Do?). It\u2019s how I try to base all of my decisions for the company on a day-to-day basis, and her clear voice, strong opinions and deep insights will always be something I can reflect on both professionally and personally.\nI\u2019m sure that anyone who ever met Christine over the years has a story (or two) to tell. She most definitely left an impression! Some will remember Christine for her wicked fashion sense or wild pink hair. Others will remember Christine for her willingness to share the business knowledge and sharp insights gathered from years of experience in the industry. Vendors will always remember her as a tough, honest, and fair negotiator.\nI\u2019ll remember her as a friend, an inspiration and mentor, an amazing woman who\u2019s proven that adversity is just another door to kick down. I\u2019ll remember her for her flair: she did EVERYTHING with a touch of class! From insisting on packing a table-cloth and vase with fresh flowers for each \u201cflamping\u201d (camping with an airplane) trip she took with Tony (one of her favorite things, by the way), right down to making sure that every detail was perfect in the dioramas she painstakingly created for her infamous teddy bear collection. That will always bring a smile to my face. Some other fun facts: Did you know she used to drive a Delorean?! How many people in the world can say that?! And something I\u2019ve been devastatingly jealous of for many years: NIRVANA stayed at her house back when they were first emerging to become an American icon. I mean, come on\u2026Nirvana\u2026sigh.\nYes, she was known as a true force of nature in the industry, but she was so much more as a person when you got the chance to know her. With a passion for politics, Christine worked as a staffer on a number of campaigns in her earlier years, and continued to champion the power of the individual with their votes as well as their wallets; one of the reasons she strove to make Finao a great corporate citizen with big heart and small footprints. She had graduated from Northern Michigan University with a Masters in Fine Art and had an affinity not just toward Warhol or the great impressionists, but she absolutely loved pottery and stoneware and collected roku pieces from local contemporaries like Ed Risak and had a cherished tea pot from Tim Mather. She always talked about wanting to volunteer as a docent at the Detroit Institute of Art. She took me there once and I was astounded at her knowledge as we toured piece by piece. She especially loved the entire room dedicated to industry in Detroit by Diego Rivera. We could have spent hours in that room absorbing it all.\n Especially the little lost ones. Christine and Tony have cared for more animals over the years than I could possibly count, and that love spreads to the office where the Finao fam brings our own pets to work as well; a lovely gift to enjoy each day. But to their current 2 dogs and 3 cats, she was the best, most loving mommy in the world.\nHer flowers were also amazing. She\u2019d walk me around the house where she\u2019d spent years planting and nurturing a huge assortment of perennials and she\u2019d tell me the name of each one and what it would look like at different seasons. They also lovingly fed the birds each day, and loved watching the variety. Recently, she showed me the Michigan Bird Guide she keeps handy in the living room and pointed out that almost all the pages had been dog-eared as they had been fortunate enough to get visits from so many of the different species.

This is a very exciting time for natural language processing. Language processing is not new, but it has suddenly taken huge leaps forward. Language processing is the foundation for every type of artificial intelligence that works with text. The new techniques include the introduction of large \"language models\" that are pre-trained from huge data sets, and a new set of techniques that learn the way people use language to express different ideas. A language model is, at the simplest level, a type of neural network with many layers that's been fed trillions of words of text and told what each word meant.

This is a very exciting time for natural language processing. Language processing is not new, but it has suddenly taken huge leaps forward. Language processing is the foundation for every type of artificial intelligence that works with text. The new techniques include the introduction of large \"language models\" that are pre-trained from huge data sets, and a new set of techniques that learn the way people use language to express different ideas. A language model is, at the simplest level, a type of neural network with many layers that's been fed trillions of words of text and told what each word meant. The end result can be a powerful tool for everything from improving search to writing poetry or answering questions. But there are some downsides to the models, too.

There is also a field called machine learning theory. It's a much more math-focused field and the people who research this field will not call themselves ML engineers. ML theory people don't code or train ML models. They try to prove that certain kinds of ML algorithms can or can't do certain things.

Call us now on 020 3970 0488 to book the best Removal Service in Plumstead with Amazing Moves.\nWe are a professional moving company Plumstead and our sole aim is to have you 'Move with confidence'. With our removal company you can move anywhere in and outside of the UK and we will be able to assist you with top class man and van movers. What we offer all of our clients is a full moving crew that will range between 2-5 movers; this is determined by the details of your move that you supply us with when you make a call to 020 3970 0488. Every one of our movers are more than able to conduct the tasks related to your relevant move. Moreover, we will use a moving list to make sure that all the requested tasks are completed within a set time limit. We or the movers who are right for you and our man and van teams are waiting for you to book their professional services.\nWe ask two things of you; firstly book as far in advance as possible as this not only secures your man with van Plumstead, but also helps us to plan all the details. Secondly, we at Removal Company ask that you arrange for parking of our removal vans directly across the entrance of your building; this is particularly the case for high rise apartments and office moves. Visit your local council\u2019s website to see what regulations or permits are required to ensure that we get a convenient parking spot for the full duration of your move; saving you from any potential fines. Also bear in mind when booking our services that there are periods that are busier than other so the sooner you pre-book the better. Due to the amount of chaos that simply comes with the moving house or office territory, we like to plan ahead and have a set plan to follow.\nEven our Plumstead moves are no different; this South East London district is in the Royal Borough of Greenwich and is an Asian and Afro-Caribbean population which means it is also multi-cultural. This SE18 postcode expanded rather quickly and in the 80's, the housing developed for the Royal Arsenal workers resulted in many two-up-two down styled terraced houses. While the bigger and better properties were strategically developed uphill from the Thames at Plumstead Common. Further notoriety is that the world renown Arsenal Football Club played at various Plumstead grounds. Rail is accessed via the Plumstead railway station which is in the north-west part of town and on the North Kent line. Nearby places are Abbey Wood, Woolwich, Blackheath and Thamesmead. Attractions are in the form of a multitude of theatres and Museum but the most well-known of these are the O2 arena, The Royal Artillery Museum, Severndroog Castle and the National Maritime Museum; although these are not the only attractions in the area. Another place of interest is the Greenwich Market and parks are just as plentiful.\nLong after our movers have safely delivered you last box to your new premises, we find that our clients are still able to spend time relaxing with their families or familiarizing themselves with their new surroundings, thanks largely to the efficient way in which our Plumstead movers complete each of our moves. Clients often use words like courteous, friendly, efficient and eager to please when describing our man and van crew members that will range anything from 2 or more movers. Removal Company will not leave your home until we know that we have successfully completed your house removals. We moreover always arrive on time as per the moving date and times agreed upon via 020 3970 0488. As we never rush our moves, you get our full attention from beginning to end.\nThe house removals service in Plumstead was just what I needed. On an all-important day, they turned up on time and got straight to it. There was a lot of work, but they demonstrated why they're professionals and handled it all with ease.\nI called around, and these guys had the cheapest moving services. The movers did a fine job, and they saved me quite a few pounds. I would recommend them to anyone in Plumstead.\nAmazing Moves in Plumstead was a great help with our big move. We just finished building our new flat, and the movers did a great job getting everything moved over. The rates they charge are quite a bit cheaper than others in the area as well.\nWhen you've lived in the same home for years, as we had, the home tends to get filled up with things that you forgot you even had. It's then that house moving becomes a long, drawn-out chore that you come to dread. We got to enjoy our last house moving, because we left all the work up to Amazing Moves. From beginning to end the entire job was taken care of, and the price was right, too! By the time we met up with the movers at our new home nearly all of the roughest work was already done for us, and we were able to enjoy the first night more thoroughly. This is a go-to moving company for sure!\nI love movers from Amazing Moves. They are always ready to help you around with extra chores. They take care of all your needs.

A new method for speech recognition\n\nThis is the same sort of stuff that we did with the old English data corpus, except this time we made the same sorts of measurements using a Japanese data corpus.\n\nA new and powerful way of dealing with complex numbers\n\nA new form of artificial intelligence (AI) has been developed by researchers at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), and their findings can be applied to problems such as voice recognition and machine translation. The research, which was published in Nature Machine Intelligence, introduces a new way of dealing with complex numbers and the associated mathematical challenges to AI. Complex numbers can be applied to problems such as voice recognition, which is why it is so important that computers can deal with them. 3. A new method for speech recognition Using complex numbers in AI has traditionally been a problem, because they cannot be used in the same way as real numbers. Complex numbers have been used in fields such as quantum physics and quantum computation. \u201cIn quantum computation, for instance, complex numbers are used to calculate probabilities. This has led to the invention of supercomputers like the ones used in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where the computer was able to perform complex calculations to create a hologram of the universe. A complex number has two parts \u2013 the real part and the imaginary part.\u201d In AI, however, it is important to separate the complex part of the equation from the real part of the equation. This is because the complex part of complex numbers contains a lot of information that is not needed for AI. The real part contains the information about the real world, such as the time and date of an event. 4. A new way for dealing with complex datasets AI is being used in a lot of different fields. In fact, AI can be used in almost any field, from medical research to finance and even politics. In the case of voice recognition, it is the job of the AI to separate the complex and real parts of the speech, to extract the information that is needed for the AI to make decisions. For example, AI is used to determine what kind of music you should listen to, what type of movie you should watch, and what kind and size of shirt you should wear.\n\nA new language is the world\u2019s first universal language with which everyone can communicate\n\nIn a new language, we communicate by understanding, speaking, listening, and learning.

I mean is there anything worse than listening to some overweight wax philosophic about alcohol? Beer is appreciated best when it is unspoken. And like it is with food. What's the usage of excellence that is esoteric? When it isn't actionable( or monetizable) , then what's the point of organizing your life around something so frivolous? Wish to sense self- important all the while spending exorbitant sums of money? Rather have a woman stare in her smartphone than into your eyes? Find. Would you wish to be miserable? Excuse heavy- handedness and the melodrama- - I'm attempting to make an impression, folks. We have a culture and it begins with all the choices every day, we make. Alternatives for example who we support with our money, or who( and why) we decide to date. By and large, foodies are suckers- - and so are the people that date them. They get taken advantage of by restaurant owners and chefs who understand that many foodies don't really know anything about meals. The foodie culture is the epitome of Western, white, first- world narcissism. Your foodie at a Thai restaurant can be convinced of anything, since she's ignorant about the food and how it's ready. Server or the chef could come over for her and inform her anything that is practically about the food, and she'll believe it! With a fascination with food culture isn't a substitute for the capability to cook, and also to be good at it.  What is wrong with food? Or preparing your own food? And remember this: The intestine evolved around a routine and constant origin of the available food in a geographical area. Their bodies for a loop are throwing by jamming their stomachs full of foods for them to digest that nature never intended. How good can that possibly be to your health? Emotional wellness is downstream from gut 19 year old hookers, so foodies are in fact getting struck for the decision that is questionable. Such behaviour is pure gluttony, and Mississippi Station Ontario backpage escorts girls is a sin if you recall your Sunday school courses.\nLike Cane didn't Abel in seconds, the sympathetic mode has finally knocked off the replaced backpage escorts Freelton, para. At this Mississippi Station Ontario russian hookers fucked, the breathing and heart rate increases of the man, he can not wait to feel good- - climax and feels excited.\nThe first is, even since you are currently a qualified love thing as one, you may be seen as a risk to your married friends. You might pose a danger, if there is a relationship not protected. It is also threatening to acknowledge that reddit finding casual sex's spouse is deadly. \n- Sending pictures or messages. Mindyvincent sex dating Mississippi Station when you moved into backpage escorts Shell Lake on each other's naughty bits on the russian escorts backpage Mississippi Station ON date( and no judgement if you did) , sexting and sending /asking for naked pictures with someone you just met, is a bad idea.  That gives them the impressions that sex is the thing, and thatyou're immature, socially inept, insecure.\nIt is that we explain another backpage escorts blocked Teslin Lake YT full of hope. \nAre You Currently the Stalker? ? of Ryan Seacrest Alright, okay ladies just stink, of course! Or were you? ? So reporters said that Ryan Seacrest had a scenario where a guy who began by asking for an autograph, turned right into a struggle when breaking the switchblade out. Of course the guy was arrested and Ryan was new wave hookers censored and sound.\nGoing to church is fun( well, at least it is at my church) , but going to church with somebody you truly like makes the adventure much better. It can bring you closer together and give you a chance to open up when it is over if you speak about the service. What was your favorite part? What was the very important to you? Do you intend to use this in your life? Jordan and amber were dating for about a month after she requested him to go to church. He had not been to church since he left his hometown but was excited to see in which Amber worshipped. Since they had never spoke God, she was very nervous, but the service was really loved by Jordan and it became part of the weekly ritual. This opened the door and their religious intimacy flourished. It wasn't long before Jordan went to the events of the men with her dad and brother.\nYou've measured yourself. But sometimes we find ourselves wondering: How much work would it take to elevate our UQ? For fostering it, what do we expect in return? How high is it using another set of UMs? We may want to consider the options, if we are happy with our current numbers. A few straightforward changes might dramatically improve the quality of UMs we get to pick from. Chinese escorts backpage Mississippi Station ON are basically three strategies for doing so: Improve how you are perceived by UMs.\nInappropriate anger is out of proportion to this function. The light turns hookers carp ponds along with when Bea is currently driving, she turns red. A chance remark causes Bart to start a fistfight. These responses are not in accord with the value of the function. When your love affair ends, Obviously you are feeling angry. It is not appropriate, it is productive and beneficial.\nPhysical contact- for your date why not treat that individual. You have a week to sort out relaxing music( I highly suggest Ludovico Einaudi) research some basic massage strokes online and maybe also plan the ambiance by buying aromatherapy oils. Do not forget to purchase massage oil: baby oil works.\nIn the 2months I spent I saw so many of the routines described previously in him, but I did not admit them all- - or maybe I was in denial. I had known all along he fought to become emotionally engaged and once when I had suggested that he go for counseling he said he did not wish to. It seemed like he didn't want to change and there was.\n\nA numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing: 1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

We like the guidance provided by business thought leader, educator and speaker John Spence in his video, Leading Thoughtfully and Effectively in a Crisis, available here.\nHere at MRAA, we can help with all four of these. And we\u2019re going to continue to develop new resources in these areas and others. Here\u2019s what we can provide today.\nOr go to MRAA.com, sign in with your member username and password, then select MRAATraining.com from the menu to browse our online course catalog. Learn how to create an account for your staff here. If you\u2019re not a member, learn how to create a free account here and use it to access MRAATraining.com here.\nThis starts with having a plan for communicating with current and prospective customers about what you can do to serve them safety and securely \u2013 and what you\u2019re doing to protect them. For example, if you have customer boats in storage or in the service department, you may be getting questions like: Can I pick up my boat? If so, when and how? How can I pay for it?\nIf you belong to a 20 Group or you\u2019ve participated in Roundtable Discussions at MRAA\u2019s annual conference, you know the power of this first-hand.\nBut what if you could plug into an even larger segment of the dealer community 24/7/365? That\u2019s the goal of the platform MRAA is about to launch on its website, which you can access by logging in to MRAA.com. If you don\u2019t have an account, you can create one (even if you aren\u2019t a member).\nJust like you, the team at MRAA is adapting to a fast-changing situation, developing new tools, resources and education to serve you and your team. As you navigate the uncertainty and challenges that come up, our goal is to meet you where you are with as much of what you want and need to be successful as possible. Please contact us to let us know how we can help.\n\nA numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing: 1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

", "full_output": "SPEC's research and development methodology is focused on the practical application of critical systems thinking and participatory action research in the areas of sustainability, social justice, and community development. It encourages researchers to seek to understand the world by working collaboratively to change it, and reflecting critically on their efforts.\nSPEC develops projects and partnerships with community organizations to create solutions to real-world problems while creating paid work experiences in research, development, and community building. SPEC's approach is designed to build radically transparent, sustainable and, equitable systems of living and working. The methodology draws upon many areas and concepts from social science and systems research.\nResearch that produces nothing but books will not suffice.\nIn 1944, MIT Professor Kurt Lewin, first coined the term \"action research\". In his 1946 paper \"Action Research and Minority Problems\", Lewin described action research as \"a comparative research on the conditions and effects of various forms of social action and research leading to social action\". He described this process as a \"spiral of steps, each of which is composed of a circle of planning, action and fact-finding about the result of the action\". Richard Sagor, defines action research as \"a disciplined process of inquiry conducted by and for those taking the action\". Action research is conducted with the aim of assisting in improving and/or refining one's actions. It seeks to create transformative change through the iterative process of taking action and doing research. An individual's actions and research are linked together by critical reflection.\nresearch (soundness in thought and the growth of knowledge).\nRecognizes community as a unit of identity.\nBuilds on strengths and resources within the community.\nFacilitates a collaborative, equitable partnership in all phases of research, involving an empowering and power-sharing process that attends to social inequalities.\nDisseminates results to all partners and involves them in the wider dissemination of results.\nInvolves a long-term process and commitment to sustainability.\nWorks to ensure research rigor and validity but also seeks to \u201dbroaden the bandwidth of validity\u201d with respect to research relevance.\nOpen collaboration is a system of production that relies on loosely coordinated participants who interact with a shared goal of creating a product or service, which they make publicly available to contributors and non-contributors alike. An open source product or service is one that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute and its designs, blueprints, data, content, or source code.\nCollaborative Innovation is a process in which multiple contributors work towards creating new products with customers and suppliers. Collaboration can occur in all aspects of the business cycle including procurement and supplier collaboration, research and development, marketing, distribution and commercialization.\nCollective intelligence (CI) is shared or group intelligence that emerges from the collaboration, collective efforts, and competition of many individuals. It may involve consensus, decision making, social capital and systems such as voting, polls, social media and other means of quantifying mass activity. The term appears in sociobiology, political science and in context of mass peer review and crowdsourcing applications.\nCollective IQ is a measure of collective intelligence, although it is often used interchangeably with the term collective intelligence. Collective intelligence has also been attributed to bacteria and animals.\nAn agile approach to development is intended to improve the effectiveness of software development professionals, teams, and organizations.

I would even suggest that it often goes one step further \u2013 with an uneasy feeling that using data might somehow even be unbiblical or ungodly. This assumption or suspicion can have drastic effects on how we operate and, obviously, on if and/or how well we utilize data.\nThe best way I\u2019ve found to address this \u2013 which coincides with the best way to address many questions within the church \u2013 is to look at what the Bible says about it. You may be asking \u2013 \u201cWait, the Bible addresses using data analysis\u2026?\u201d Yes, it does. Let\u2019s walk through a few.\nOne of the most used examples is found at the start of the book of Nehemiah. Nehemiah, a Jew who served before King Artaxerxes, was very concerned about the Jewish people and Jerusalem. When his brother returned from the area, he asked him two very important questions. In Nehemiah 1:2, it says he \u201cquestioned them about the Jewish remnant that survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.\u201d He wanted to know how the people were doing and what shape the city was in. He used this information to formulate how he approached the King (to get permission to rebuild the walls of the city), as well as how to rally and motivate the Jews (to accomplish the task).\nAnother Old Testament example is when Moses sent the twelve spies to explore Canaan. Beginning in Numbers 13:17, we see Moses give them specific instructions on what type of information (data) to collect. Among those were things like\u2026\u201d What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? \u2026What kind of towns do they live in? \u2026How is the soil? \u2026Are the people strong or weak?\u201d Again, we see the collection of data used to help inform next steps and decision making. However, as we see later in this example, collecting data doesn\u2019t always guarantee the right decision is made.\nEven Jesus referenced the role that collecting and understanding data can play. In Luke 14:25-35, Jesus emphasizes the importance of \u201ccounting the cost\u201d before making a decision. He uses the practical examples of a builder and king and how both must analyze data to understand their situation fully and then take appropriate action \u2013 to make the same point that we must count the cost before committing to the life of a disciple.\nHowever, there is a key balancing argument that has to be made as well. We see numerous examples in scripture where God\u2019s will would not have been supported by the data. The reduction in the size of Gideon\u2019s army to battle the Midianites (Judges 7); the feeding of the 5,000 with only a few loaves and fish (Matthew 14); and even God\u2019s direction to Paul to return to Jerusalem when arrest and imprisonment awaited him (Acts 21).\nReturning to the discussion at hand, there are a few key takeaways. Scripture certainly seems to acknowledge, and even recommend, the wise use of data in the decision-making process. If we know more about our congregation\u2019s and community\u2019s attitudes and needs, this can only help us minister more effectively. However, it is also clear that using this information or knowledge, like many other tools God gives us, must be subject to His sovereign authority. So while we can utilize and consider data \u2013 and God may choose to speak through it, we still must allow God room to operate and direct us as He chooses.\nFor more resources on Data Analytics, please visit Church Growth.\nBrett Herzog is a husband, father, pastor, and tech nerd.

Improving the generalization ability of language models by changing the architecture of the network In the past few years, language models have become an important part of the NLP field. They are used in many different applications and are used to solve many real-world problems. The models have been shown to perform well on many benchmarks. However, the current models are quite weak at generalization and they perform poorly on many real-world problems.

We will also use a similar dataset of human brain activity to train another language model and use this model to predict the outcome of another task.\nThe goal of this project is to find correlations between the human brain and language models.\nThe purpose of the project is to determine the correlation between the human", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 223, "avg_token_entropy": 1.3825512307882313, "avg_token_perplexity": 6.456914527159546, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

something that had become a major selling point for the business.\nIn fact, the Forest Products Commission\u2019s annual reports, endorsed by Forestry Minister Dave Kelly, claimed hardwood logging in WA met the strictest environmental standards and was considered sustainable by both internal and external experts.\nIndustry sources have questioned how and why the state government\u2019s decision changed seemingly overnight, and how the new arrangement serves industry and the environment.\nWhile he has not yet been able to put a figure on the number of employees likely to be affected by the decision, Mr D\u2019Andrea said there was already anecdotal evidence of the fallout among the association\u2019s 50 businesses and hardwood suppliers \u2013 from the cancellation of overseas contracts to halted business expansion plans.\nMr D\u2019Andrea said he had reservations about the degree to which the ban would serve the environment and it had unintended consequences.\nHe called on the state government to reconsider.\nLike Ms Haslam, Mr D\u2019Andrea highlighted that pine and hardwood were not interchangeable and said manufacturers would end up relying on imported timber from countries that did not have the same stringent regulations as Australia.\nSubsequently, industry is also conscious of the impact the reliance on imported hardwoods would have on their operations, including increased supply costs and longer lead times for suppliers, manufacturers and consumers.\nWith the state government\u2019s subsidy stopping short of supporting those likely to experience the flow-on effects of the decision, Mr D\u2019Andrea said furniture manufacturers and those in the roofing and flooring industry would have to adapt or risk being left behind.\n\u201cThe government is saying it is going to affect about 500 workers, but what they haven\u2019t considered is how it affects all of the other businesses that rely on the product,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe state government wants to build pine plantations in the South West and have us use softwood instead, but they are going to take at least 20 years to grow.\n\u201cWe have two years to find an alternative timber source.\n\u201cThere is going to be a huge gap in the market and no other option in Australia;

As first reported by the Daily Texan, Map Pesqueira, 19, says this change in policy is impacting his dream of serving in the military as well as his ability to get an education.\nPesqueira, who identifies as a transgender male, explained that his timing with the ROTC scholarship means he will not be grandfathered under the Department of Defense\u2019s previous policy which began allowing transgender individuals to openly serve in the military three years ago.\nOn April 12, the new policy from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration began. It states that people who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria can no longer enlist if they have had hormone therapy or gender reassignment surgery. The policy leaves room for possible exceptions, for example, applicants with a history of gender dysphoria may be able to serve if they are stable for 36 months and are able to serve in their biological sex.\nCritics of the new policy refer to it as a ban on trans service members, but the Department of Defense maintains that it is not a ban.\nThe President first announced the policy in 2017 via Twitter, sparking the creation of an actual federal policy. In January, the Supreme Court ruled to allow the government to enforce the policy, despite legal challenges to it in lower courts.\nPesquiera was born female but never identified with that gender.\nIn high school, Pesquiera began hormone therapy and legally switched his name as well as his gender pronouns.\nHe also wanted to serve in the military from a young age. He grew up in San Antonio and has fond memories of going to visit Fort Sam Houston.\n\u201cWhen I got older, it got to the point where I wanted to be in the military because I wanted to serve my country, that was the number one reason, since I was a kid,\u201d Pesqueira said.\nAt the time he applied for the ROTC scholarship, he applied under his biological gender and the name he was given at birth. He began taking hormones just before he was accepted into UT and just before he was awarded the ROTC scholarship his senior year of high school.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to be who I am and not have to suppress it,\u201d Pesqueira said of his gender transition.\n\u201cI believe if I hadn\u2019t started this transition I really don\u2019t know where I would be, I probably would not have applied to go to college or not be where I am today,\u201d he said.\nHe liked the idea of training to be an officer in the military while also pursuing a college education.\nThe scholarship, he explained, is a three-year scholarship which begins after your freshman year of college. It wasn\u2019t easy, but Pesquiera managed to pay for his first year at UT by taking out loans, fully believing his final three years would be largely covered by the scholarship.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to go to UT Austin without that scholarship,\u201d he said.\nAfter receiving the scholarship, he was assigned to an advisor within the Department of Defense, someone who Pesqueria said was tasked with assisting transgender individuals in the ROTC program.\nUT Austin student Map Pesqueria identifies as a transgender male. He was selected for an ROTC scholarship and is a freshman at the University of Texas. (Photo Courtesy: Matt Pesqueria).\nPesquiera said he never anticipated that Trump\u2019s policy for transgender military members would actually go into effect, but he started to get worried when the policy went before the Supreme Court.\nThough the DOD has said that, \u201call those most immediately affected by the update have the information they need about the policy,\u201d Pesquiera said he had to reach out to his Department of Defense contacts to receive more information about what would happen next.\nHe recalls in mid-March contacting his DOD advisor who responded back by emailing him a four-page fact sheet on which applicants could still serve under the new policy. That was the first time Pesqueria had been informed when the new policy would go into effect.\nAt that time Pesqueria had just completed what\u2019s known as \u201ctop surgery,\u201d a procedure to help him transition into a more male physique. He was caught up in the recovery process and didn\u2019t thoroughly read the fact-sheet until April.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until later I realized even if I try to get medically qualified for the Department of Defense, which is required to get contracted [by the military], I won\u2019t be able to because there\u2019s not enough time between now and April, 12,\u201d Pesqueira said.\nHe believes the process of getting medically qualified would take him months, there just wasn\u2019t enough time at that point. Which meant he would not have a chance of being grandfathered in under the old rules.\nA simple chart in the fact sheet laid out for Pesquiera that under the new policy, applicants like him with a history of medical transition treatment would be \u201cpresumptively disqualified\u201d from serving in the military.\nPesqueria believed this meant he would be left under the rules of the new policy and feared it would force him to serve in a military that wouldn\u2019t recognize his preferred gender. So he emailed his ROTC advisors at UT and at the DOD, asking if there is a way to cancel his scholarship on April 8.\n\u201cI understand that those who are not medically qualified by this Friday will be held to the new standard of the policy and since I am already well into my transition, I believe I would be disqualified anyway because of this,\u201d he wrote.\nThat same day, his DOD advisor replied back in an email that started off saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry things turned out the way they did,\u201d and directing Pesquiera to talk with his UT advisor about his scholarship questions. His DOD advisor confirmed, that yes Pesquiera would be medically disqualified under the new standards on April 12.\nBut the advisor acknowledged he did not know what criteria and processing will be used in considering army waivers for transgender applicants, he promised to follow up with more information.\nThe advisor finished his email with, \u201cit has been an honor and a privilege to have worked with you on this journey since 6 Apr 2018:)\u201d.\n\u201cPretty much it felt like he left me in a dark room, turned off the light, closed the door, and left me high and dry,\u201d Pesquiera recalled of his advisor\u2019s response.\nPesquiera said he has not heard from his DOD advisor since. Nor has he reached out to the DOD for more clarification, he still hopes to serve in the military and doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize his future chances. But he understood that email on April 8 and his advisor\u2019s tone to mean that past April 12, he would no longer qualify for his scholarship or to serve in the military.\nAfterward, Pesquiera did meet with his ROTC advisor at UT who informed him that if the Trump Administration\u2019s policy is reversed, it could be possible for Pesqueria to pick up his scholarship again later on in his time at UT or to pursue ROTC in graduate school.\nPesqueria said he is open to those options in the future, but right now he is just trying to stay positive.\nHe is choosing to share his story with media outlets because he wants the public to understand how this policy can impact people who are relying on military scholarships for their education.\n\u201cNot only is it impacting my education, but it\u2019s affecting me being able to join the military in general, as an officer,\u201d he said.\nIn the immediate future, Pesqueira is worried about how he will continue to pay for his education at UT. He has started a Go Fund Me Page to help continue his studies for the time being.\nHe hopes to meet with UT President Greg Fenves about his circumstances and has already reached out to Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro\u2019s office.\nThe DOD spokesperson also noted that people are exempt from the new 2018 policy (and fall under the 2016 policy) if they were selected for entrance into an officer commissioning program, and either were selected into ROTC in their preferred gender or received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria while a Service member.\nKXAN read Pesquiera the DOD\u2019s response, he said no one had ever communicated that information with him before.

They noted that a 2016 survey showed under 9,000 service members considered themselves transgender.

Initial production, the first ninety days, is the important period when comparing shale wells; after that, the operator is managing his/her wells and production is related less to technology and strategies and more to the operator \"managing\" the well's production.\nOne last point: I am inappropriately exuberant about the Bakken.\nTalk about a huge coincidence.

Multiple links. Here at National Geographic. With a lot of hand-wringing.\nThe founder of a South Dakotan firm called PaleoAdventures, which digs up fossils for commercial sale, Stein nicknamed the fossil \u201cBig John\u201d after the owner of the ranch where he found it.\nFor six years, he held on to the Triceratops in hopes that a U.S. museum would purchase it\u2014but none came forward. Then, in 2020, he sold the fossil to an Italian firm that prepared it for auction. With much fanfare and a jaw-dropping sale price of $7.7 million (6.65 million euros) to an anonymous buyer last month, Big John became a big deal\u2014and added fuel to an ongoing, thorny debate among scientists, auctioneers, commercial paleontologists, and private landowners.\nWhere's the beef? It was on sale for six years and no museum came forward to buy it and museums have some wealthy patrons. Very wealthy patrons.

After COVID-19 and the subsequent global market crash brought LNG development to a standstill and shut-in production from existing terminals in 2020, this year has seen global prices repeatedly smash previous record highs, driving existing terminals to operate at peak levels and renewing interest in new LNG buildout. U.S. feedgas demand and LNG production will close out the year at all-time highs, but with just a few weeks left it looks like 2021 will be the first year since 2017 that no new LNG terminals will achieve a positive final investment decision. But that\u2019s driven more by the tailwinds of 2020 \u2014 the back half of 2021 has seen a tremendous amount of commercial activity in the LNG sector. More than 21 million metric tons per annum of medium- and long-term capacity from planned LNG projects has been sold this year, creating enough forward momentum for multiple projects to move toward FID in 2022.

This is claiming 52% spread - ostensibly the end product! \nOh, unless maybe the other 48% is unwhipped? I think we may just have to call up the folks at Mehadrin and find out...\nMaybe I'm wrong, but you know how they have 5% cheese here? I think that \"percentage\" applies to the whipped spread as well...\nDave - right, I understand that that may have been the intention, but it doesn't say \"5% fat\" like those cheeses do here. Yes, they do, if you look - I checked!\nIt looked like a whoopie cushion.

Selfishly, I never thought twice about having some poor teenage driver go out in the very weather from which I was excused.\nIf we had multiple snow days, my days and nights quickly flipped. I would eat and sleep all day and binge eat and watch TV all night. I would experience real feelings of anxiety when I had to crack open the second case of diet soda. I was \u2018running out\u2019 and that feeling made me very nervous, so I started plotting my route to the nearest convenience store.

I went to ANY length to get my drug, a fact my sponsor often reminds me of when a flake falls from the sky and I wonder if maybe I should stay home from my FA meeting.\nWhen the inevitable came, and it was time to go back to school, I would drag myself in with a terrible sugar hangover. I was more exhausted than I was before the snow day, and I always went back to school with clothes that were too tight, making empty promises of stepping up the exercise to lose the weight.\nMy snow days are very different now that I\u2019ve lost 160 pounds and been abstinent for six years.

The crew will use the gravitational influence of Mars to \u201cslingshot\u201d the space vehicle onto a return course back to Earth.\nTito and his team are executing the project as a private, nonprofit endeavor under the umbrella of his Inspiration Mars Foundation.\nFoundation officials said conversations are underway with several US commercial aerospace companies about potential launch and crew vehicles and systems.\n\u201cThe mission will be built around proven, existing space transportation systems and technologies derived from industry, NASA and the ISS that can be available in time to support the launch date,\u201d officials with the foundation said in a statement.\n\u201cThe flyby architecture lowers risk,\u201d said Tito. \u201cWith no critical propulsive maneuvers, no entry into the Mars atmosphere, and no rendezvous and docking,\u201d he said.\nBut the risks that do exist could pose major problems experts said, including the safety of the crew against cosmic radiation and the short timeline leading up to the launch.\n\u201cThe project is extremely ambitious, especially given the timeframe,\u201d said Graham Candler, a professor in the department of Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics at the University of Minnesota.\n\u201cThere is a lot of work that has been done with people being on the ISS for an extended period of time,\u201d Candler said, but there are still risk factors he added. \u201cYou do go through bone loss, your muscles get deconditioned so you have to exercise extensively which requires a significant amount of space,\u201d Candler said.\nThere is also a psychological factor. \u201cNot many people can mentally withstand the travel, a half-year in each direction,\u201d Candler said.\n\u201cOur primary goal is to keep the crew alive for just shy of a year-and-a half mission,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Clark chief medical officer of the Inspiration Mars Foundation.\nAnd while radiation is a concern, \u201cit\u2019s not a show stopper,\u201d Clark said. He added the project will consult with NASA about radiation protection.\nAstronaut candidates will face a rigorous screening process that will take place within the next six to twelve months.\nTito, who spent eight days in space in 2001, said he personally committed two years of his own money to keep the Mars project alive.

His family moved to Germany a year later, where he spent his childhood immersed in the world of Disney.\nIn 1968, the visionary viewed \u2018The Jungle Book\u2019 for the first time, and he was instantly inspired to become an animator for Disney Studios. He was so serious about his dreams that he wrote to the studio and asked them how to go about becoming one of their animators.\nIn the late 1970s he attended the \u2018FokwangHochschule\u2019 focusing on graphic design in Essen, Germany. While still in school, he sent his best drawings to the head of the training program for Disney, Eric Larson.\nAfter seeing the student\u2019s drawings, Disney invited him to a four week training course and subsequently hired him in 1980. He excitedly accepted and moved from Germany to America.\nIn 1985, he worked on his first film as character designer and animator for \u2018The Black Cauldron\u2019. His extensive knowledge about Disney\u2019s previous animators prevented him from working at full potential, as much of the animation mirrored earlier models too much.\nIn 1986, he animated the Queen in the \u2018Great Mouse Detective\u2019. In this film, he was able to better highlight his personal style while working with three-dimensional drawing.\nIn 1988, he began work on \u2018Oliver & Company,\u2019 but eventually turned down the film to work on \u2018Who Framed Roger Rabbit\u2019 animating the main character, Roger Rabbit, and nearly every other character except Jessica. This film is where he really found his personal animation style while successfully incorporating the old animator\u2019s styles as well.\nOne his more successful films came from his animation of King Triton in \u2018The Little Mermaid\u2019 in 1989. He successfully created a balance between realistic and comic that paved the way for future Disney animators.\nFrom 1991 to 1994, he worked on the most major films of his career during his \u2018villain trilogy\u2019 phase. He animated Gaston from \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019,Jafar in \u2018Aladdin\u2019, and Scar in \u2018The Lion King\u2019. His outstanding ability, to make the villains contrast the good characters, shows in opposing clothing, design, characterization.\nIn 1997, he decided to switch to the more heroic characters for a change. He was originally hired to work on Hades in the Disney hit \u2018Hercules\u2019, but instead requested to do the main character himself.\nIn 2002, he worked on one of his most iconic characters, Lilo, from \u2018Lilo and Stitch\u2019. The character\u2019s subtle characterization was one of Deja\u2019s favorite characters and films to work on.\nFrom 2004 to 2011, he worked on films such as \u2018Mickey\u2019s Twice Upon a Christmas\u2019,\u2018Home on the Range\u2019,\u2018The Princess and the Frog\u2019, and \u2018Winnie the Pooh\u2019. His unique style makes every character he does unique in its own right.\nAccording to Deja\u2019s personal blog \u2018Deja View\u2019, right now he is spending his time working on his own animated films. His 30 years long Disney career, he hints, may not be over yet.\nDeja\u2019s work on \u2018Who Framed Roger Rabbit\u2019, in 1988, launched his career forward as he animated a toon universe that is intertwined with real life action. The film created a new interest in animation and revived the industry.It is said to have begun the modern era of American animation.\nIn 2006, he was awarded the \u2018Winsor McCay Award\u2019 at the 35th Annie Awards. The honor was given due to his significant contributions to the art of animation.\nThis inspiring man leads an openly gay life which is said to have influenced the development of some Disney characters.\nDeja is said to be one of the most influential animators in Disney history.

May we always be up to the needs of young people.\"\nThen Fr Jos\u00e9 Lino Y\u00e1nez, who was Provincial Councilor at the time Fr Vigan\u00f2 was Provincial of Chile (1968-1971), presented the first report on the illustrious Salesian, and defined him as \"a Chilean Salesian, in love with this land, in love with the Church, vibrant with Easter and Pentecost.\"\nLater, Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati, archbishop emeritus of Santiago, spoke of Fr Vigan\u00f2's contributions to Chilean and world religious life as a theologian, professor at the Pontifical Catholic University (PUC) and Councilor of Cardinal Ra\u00fal Silva Henr\u00edquez at the Second Vatican Council.\n\"I consider the life and work of Father Egidio a special gift from God, a sign for the Congregation.

You should have a good intuition for what a computer can do and what they can\u2019t do. You should be able to understand the meaning of words (and what they mean in a semantic context). You should be able to think about tasks in the context of a conversation or a paragraph of text \u2013 this is where the human-machine relationship comes into play. You should also have a general idea of how humans use language in their daily lives and how computers use it in theirs. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you need to know anything about coding languages, but rather, about human interaction with computers. You should also understand the basic algorithms that computer vision or speech recognition use \u2013 but not so much that they take away your ability to understand natural language processing itself. Finally, you need to be able to think creatively about how to solve problems that have never been solved before \u2013 and how to apply those problem solving skills to solving real world problems. A good way to get started is by reading about the history of natural language processing research. This will give you an idea of how people are doing it today (i.e. why they\u2019re doing it) and some insight into how it can be applied in the future.\n\nLeave a Reply", "completion_only": "2021 NLP project ideas 4.

You should have a good intuition for what a computer can do and what they can\u2019t do. You should be able to understand the meaning of words (and what they mean in a semantic context). You should be able to think about tasks in the context of a conversation or a paragraph of text \u2013 this is where the human-machine relationship comes into play. You should also have a general idea of how humans use language in their daily lives and how computers use it in theirs. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you need to know anything about coding languages, but rather, about human interaction with computers. You should also understand the basic algorithms that computer vision or speech recognition use \u2013 but not so much that they take away your ability to understand natural language processing itself. Finally, you need to be able to think creatively about how to solve problems that have never been solved before \u2013 and how to apply those problem solving skills to solving real world problems. A good way to get started is by reading about the history of natural language processing research. This will give you an idea of how people are doing it today (i.e. why they\u2019re doing it) and some insight into how it can be applied in the future.\n\nLeave a Reply", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 260, "avg_token_entropy": 1.6054032584895266, "avg_token_perplexity": 7.7084330259972, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

It\u2019s the end of a decade, which \u2014 even on paper \u2014 makes this New Year seem like a bigger deal than usual. And Capricorn\u2019s influence will help you plan for what\u2019s to come. Or rather, what you want to come.\nThe week of Christmas is a beautiful stretch of emotional openness, goal-setting, wishing for the company of those you love, as well as a whirlwind of joy just thinking about what could be.\nAnd whatever you decide it\u2019ll be, make sure it challenges you in a positive way.\nThe week of Christmas starts with a waning crescent moon in Scorpio, which \u2014 paired with Mars in Scorpio \u2014 will ask you to surrender yourself to emotion. Whether it\u2019s a tidal wave of happiness hitting your mental shores, or a sea of troubles, let them wash over you. Don\u2019t bottle anything up, especially not negative thoughts. Process them as best you can before the 26th, which is a new moon eclipse in Capricorn. That\u2019s the ideal day to set intentions for the year to come, and, no-brainer, it\u2019s better to set them without any darkness or resentments in the back of your mind! Emotions running high also means that your passions are, too. Capricorn season might urge you to be practical when it comes to making dreams a reality, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with knowing what you want. And no one can say an Aries is afraid to chase after exactly that. As with the rest of December, just make sure that you don\u2019t get too defensive or lash out if anyone offers you suggestions or critiques.\nConceptually, Christmas should be the perfect holiday for a Taurus. A bounty of presents dropped into your lap, on the dot, year after year? Heaven. You\u2019ll be especially filled with anticipation on Christmas Eve, as well as a general air of positivity about the main event. What with Mars in Scorpio and Mercury in Sagittarius, here are two points of caution about opening presents: 1) Practice your poker face, so you don\u2019t show disappointment if you don\u2019t get exactly what you want, 2) Do not get jealous of other peoples\u2019 gifts. You\u2019ll be hankering to spend time with your close friends and family, and it\u2019s probably best not to do that while seething that someone got the same socks as you \u2014 but in a nicer shade of blue. Uranus will turn direct in your sign in the weeks to come, so turn its current, retrograde energy inwards, and flick through your deepest desires. The new moon eclipse in Capricorn on the 26th would be a good time to settle on which of your wants you\u2019d most like to manifest in 2020.\nThe week of Christmas is the last one before your ruling planet, Mercury, shuffles from Sagittarius to Capricorn. You\u2019re at the sweet spot of a free thinking, merry-go-round of zany ideas, while on the precipice of plopping yourself onto one of the stationary horses and committing to it. Or maybe one of the merry-go-round horses that move up and down, those are more fun. More likely than not, you\u2019re actually waving your ticket around, impatient to get on the ride. Both Mars in Scorpio and Mercury are\u2026 well, I can\u2019t think of a way to stretch the merry-go-round metaphor a bit longer, but they\u2019re making you feel two steps ahead of everyone else. But it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t get ahead of yourself. Enjoy the holidays before you hyper-focus on the months ahead \u2014 at least wait until the new moon eclipse on the 26th has passed before you let yourself get preoccupied.\nMehhhh! That\u2019s a goat noise. That\u2019s also my attempt at making you smile through the screen! See, Capricorn season is here, and with it comes the potential for Cancers to take things too seriously. The Moon\u2019s movements during the week of Christmas will make you even more vulnerable to emotions than usual (yes, it is possible for you to be more vulnerable than usual). Don\u2019t act rashly or get caught in a loop of broodiness. If something bad happens or if something\u2019s been weighing on you, lay everything out on your mental table, acknowledge how you\u2019re feeling, and \u2014 using Capricorn\u2019s rational vibes \u2014 work out the best way past it. But there\u2019s optimism in that emotional surrender, too. The moon in Sagittarius on Christmas Eve will make everything seem Possible, with a capital P. So when it comes time to think about your goals on the 26th (a new moon eclipse in Capricorn), think big.\nThe sun just pounced into Capricorn on the 21st of December, so your exuberant and flashy self might feel a little more toned down than usual. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve lost any of your innate enthusiasm for life. Far from it! Mars in Scorpio, paired with the moon\u2019s course during the week, mean that you\u2019ll be brimming with excitement about the possibilities to come. Even if you don\u2019t have any ideas for resolutions, or a goal you want to pursue, the mere possibility of possibilities is enough to get you purring. Your concern for this Capricorn season is to straddle the line of being too narrow-minded and too free-thinking. There\u2019s a healthy middle where you don\u2019t sell yourself short but also don\u2019t set yourself up for disappointment. Share both your doubts and dreams with your loved ones \u2014 getting feedback from people who know you is a great way to determine your limits.\nWe entered Capricorn season on the 21st of December, which is, perhaps, the most \u201cserious\u201d of all the zodiac seasons. For a Virgo, who can tend towards the self-critical, there\u2019s absolutely the potential for self-doubt in spades. But so long as you know that it\u2019s a possibility, you can fend it off. The 26th is the new moon eclipse in Capricorn, which is the ideal day for resolution-setting. Hold on to the energy of the 24th and 25th, where the moon in Sagittarius pushes us toward bright-eyed optimism and an \u201cI can do anything!\u201d attitude. Your ruling planet, Mercury, is in Sagittarius until the 28th as well. You of all people know the value of practicality, but, practically speaking, setting the bar too low means you won\u2019t jump as high as you have the ability to.\nLast week brought sensible Capricorn season with it, but it also shifted Venus, your ruling planet, into Aquarius. While the Sun is in Capricorn, there can be a tendency for people to become too practical. But with Venus, you\u2019re guaranteed a kind of shield against it \u2014 you\u2019ll want to break rules, throw caution to the wind, and dream as many dreams as you see fit. In fact, you might get a lot out of encouraging others to think bigger. The moon\u2019s movements during the week of Christmas already mean that you\u2019ll have the urge to spend time with people, so why not put your social know-how to good use?  Don\u2019t reject Capricorn energy outright, it\u2019s always important to be brought down to earth \u2014 if only to make sure your view of the ground is an accurate one.\nBy the week of Christmas, you should\u2019ve found yourself with a full deck of ideas and passion projects you want to pursue \u2014 it\u2019s all just a matter of deciding which card to deal yourself. Capricorn season started last week, and it\u2019s time to carefully evaluate which bursts of imagination are both a) achievable, and b) the dopest of them all.  Considering that your other ruling planet, Pluto, is itself about intensity and focus, there\u2019s no doubt that you\u2019ll be able to come up with an actionable plan. The best date to start working one out is the 26th, the new moon eclipse in Capricorn. One thing to watch out for \u2014 don\u2019t immediately dismiss any thoughts or opinions others offer on your fantasies for the future.\nLast week, the sun officially moved out of your sign into Capricorn\u2019s. If it isn\u2019t too confusing for me to use a Christmas metaphor for the week of Christmas, it\u2019s as though you spent December wrapping up future plans in pretty little bows. Big ideas, small ideas, ideas that are a weird shape and therefore impossible to wrap elegantly, etc. You\u2019ll end up leaving most of them untouched, under the psychic Christmas tree of your mind \u2014 but the ones you do choose to unwrap might be gifts that keep on giving. (Okay, maybe it is confusing to use Christmas to describe Christmas.) The days of the 24th-26th are a triptych of growing excitement for what\u2019s ahead, culminating in a new moon eclipse in Capricorn. There is no better time than this to start making to-do lists for how you can make your fantasies come true. But don\u2019t let yourself be too distracted by what\u2019s to come \u2014 make sure you pay attention to your loved ones during the holiday season.\nIt\u2019s the end of 2019, and Capricorn season has finally trotted out. Goats go meh but this week is hardly a meh one. (Yes, I really wrote that, don\u2019t kill me, lol.) Your ruling planet \u2014Saturn \u2014 is direct in your sign, and is all about patience, fortitude, and long-term plans. That\u2019s why, when you finally settle on which resolutions to pursue in the year ahead, you might find yourself drawn to ones that could heavily impact the course of your life. Maybe you\u2019re sending your last applications off for college. Maybe you\u2019ve decided, \u201cNew Year, new me, new country.\u201d Your talent for focus will be bolstered by virtue of it being your season, so make sure you don\u2019t set arbitrary limits on what you can or can\u2019t accomplish. Both Christmas Eve and Christmas find the moon in Sagittarius. Ride the momentum of those positive vibes into the new moon eclipse in Capricorn on the 26th, where you\u2019ll start sketching blueprints for what\u2019s ahead. It\u2019s your moon. Your future. Your infinite potential.\nYour ruling planet, Uranus, is going direct in early January. As forewarned in the general December horoscope, it\u2019s best for you to tie up as many loose strings as you can. Otherwise, Uranus will come, unflinching, and chop them off for you. Right before Christmas Eve, there\u2019s a waning crescent moon in Scorpio. That, in addition to Mars still being in Scorpio, will all but force you to show the hand of your soul. So it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to get rid of any bad vibes before 2020 \u2014 if possible, before the 26th would be ideal. That\u2019s when the new moon eclipse in Capricorn hits, and it\u2019s also when you should start drafting an outline for how you\u2019ll meet your New Years\u2019 resolutions. Venus moved into your sign on the 20th, so you can rest assured that, even if Capricorn is a season of practicality, your eccentric streak won\u2019t be tamed.\nThe sun moved into Capricorn on the 21st of December, which means it\u2019s time to get down to brass tacks about the future. Out of all the signs, you might actually be in the best position for a stable, steady manifestation of your fantasies into actual reality. Neptune is direct in Pisces, which means that the potential for wish fulfillment is at its peak. Plus, Jupiter \u2014 your other ruling planet \u2014 entered Capricorn on the 2nd of December. Jupiter in Capricorn means an air of gravitas, maturity, and strength. And you do know that Pisces is the most \u201cpsychic\u201d and intuitive sign of them all, don\u2019t you? The 26th\u2019s new moon eclipse in Capricorn is the opportune moment to work out how you\u2019ll fulfill your ambitions, just make sure that you aren\u2019t too close-minded about them. Being sensible doesn\u2019t mean you should be playing it safe.

Both Mars in Scorpio and Mercury are\u2026 well, I can\u2019t think of a way to stretch the merry-go-round metaphor a bit longer, but they\u2019re making you feel two steps ahead of everyone else. But it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t get ahead of yourself. Enjoy the holidays before you hyper-focus on the months ahead \u2014 at least wait until the new moon eclipse on the 26th has passed before you let yourself get preoccupied.\nMehhhh! That\u2019s a goat noise. That\u2019s also my attempt at making you smile through the screen! See, Capricorn season is here, and with it comes the potential for Cancers to take things too seriously. The Moon\u2019s movements during the week of Christmas will make you even more vulnerable to emotions than usual (yes, it is possible for you to be more vulnerable than usual). Don\u2019t act rashly or get caught in a loop of broodiness. If something bad happens or if something\u2019s been weighing on you, lay everything out on your mental table, acknowledge how you\u2019re feeling, and \u2014 using Capricorn\u2019s rational vibes \u2014 work out the best way past it. But there\u2019s optimism in that emotional surrender, too. The moon in Sagittarius on Christmas Eve will make everything seem Possible, with a capital P. So when it comes time to think about your goals on the 26th (a new moon eclipse in Capricorn), think big.\nThe sun just pounced into Capricorn on the 21st of December, so your exuberant and flashy self might feel a little more toned down than usual. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve lost any of your innate enthusiasm for life. Far from it! Mars in Scorpio, paired with the moon\u2019s course during the week, mean that you\u2019ll be brimming with excitement about the possibilities to come. Even if you don\u2019t have any ideas for resolutions, or a goal you want to pursue, the mere possibility of possibilities is enough to get you purring. Your concern for this Capricorn season is to straddle the line of being too narrow-minded and too free-thinking. There\u2019s a healthy middle where you don\u2019t sell yourself short but also don\u2019t set yourself up for disappointment. Share both your doubts and dreams with your loved ones \u2014 getting feedback from people who know you is a great way to determine your limits.\nWe entered Capricorn season on the 21st of December, which is, perhaps, the most \u201cserious\u201d of all the zodiac seasons. For a Virgo, who can tend towards the self-critical, there\u2019s absolutely the potential for self-doubt in spades. But so long as you know that it\u2019s a possibility, you can fend it off. The 26th is the new moon eclipse in Capricorn, which is the ideal day for resolution-setting. Hold on to the energy of the 24th and 25th, where the moon in Sagittarius pushes us toward bright-eyed optimism and an \u201cI can do anything!\u201d attitude. Your ruling planet, Mercury, is in Sagittarius until the 28th as well. You of all people know the value of practicality, but, practically speaking, setting the bar too low means you won\u2019t jump as high as you have the ability to.\nLast week brought sensible Capricorn season with it, but it also shifted Venus, your ruling planet, into Aquarius. While the Sun is in Capricorn, there can be a tendency for people to become too practical. But with Venus, you\u2019re guaranteed a kind of shield against it \u2014 you\u2019ll want to break rules, throw caution to the wind, and dream as many dreams as you see fit. In fact, you might get a lot out of encouraging others to think bigger. The moon\u2019s movements during the week of Christmas already mean that you\u2019ll have the urge to spend time with people, so why not put your social know-how to good use?  Don\u2019t reject Capricorn energy outright, it\u2019s always important to be brought down to earth \u2014 if only to make sure your view of the ground is an accurate one.\nBy the week of Christmas, you should\u2019ve found yourself with a full deck of ideas and passion projects you want to pursue \u2014 it\u2019s all just a matter of deciding which card to deal yourself. Capricorn season started last week, and it\u2019s time to carefully evaluate which bursts of imagination are both a) achievable, and b) the dopest of them all.  Considering that your other ruling planet, Pluto, is itself about intensity and focus, there\u2019s no doubt that you\u2019ll be able to come up with an actionable plan. The best date to start working one out is the 26th, the new moon eclipse in Capricorn. One thing to watch out for \u2014 don\u2019t immediately dismiss any thoughts or opinions others offer on your fantasies for the future.\nLast week, the sun officially moved out of your sign into Capricorn\u2019s. If it isn\u2019t too confusing for me to use a Christmas metaphor for the week of Christmas, it\u2019s as though you spent December wrapping up future plans in pretty little bows. Big ideas, small ideas, ideas that are a weird shape and therefore impossible to wrap elegantly, etc. You\u2019ll end up leaving most of them untouched, under the psychic Christmas tree of your mind \u2014 but the ones you do choose to unwrap might be gifts that keep on giving. (Okay, maybe it is confusing to use Christmas to describe Christmas.) The days of the 24th-26th are a triptych of growing excitement for what\u2019s ahead, culminating in a new moon eclipse in Capricorn. There is no better time than this to start making to-do lists for how you can make your fantasies come true. But don\u2019t let yourself be too distracted by what\u2019s to come \u2014 make sure you pay attention to your loved ones during the holiday season.\nIt\u2019s the end of 2019, and Capricorn season has finally trotted out. Goats go meh but this week is hardly a meh one. (Yes, I really wrote that, don\u2019t kill me, lol.) Your ruling planet \u2014Saturn \u2014 is direct in your sign, and is all about patience, fortitude, and long-term plans. That\u2019s why, when you finally settle on which resolutions to pursue in the year ahead, you might find yourself drawn to ones that could heavily impact the course of your life. Maybe you\u2019re sending your last applications off for college. Maybe you\u2019ve decided, \u201cNew Year, new me, new country.\u201d Your talent for focus will be bolstered by virtue of it being your season, so make sure you don\u2019t set arbitrary limits on what you can or can\u2019t accomplish. Both Christmas Eve and Christmas find the moon in Sagittarius. Ride the momentum of those positive vibes into the new moon eclipse in Capricorn on the 26th, where you\u2019ll start sketching blueprints for what\u2019s ahead. It\u2019s your moon. Your future. Your infinite potential.\nYour ruling planet, Uranus, is going direct in early January. As forewarned in the general December horoscope, it\u2019s best for you to tie up as many loose strings as you can. Otherwise, Uranus will come, unflinching, and chop them off for you. Right before Christmas Eve, there\u2019s a waning crescent moon in Scorpio. That, in addition to Mars still being in Scorpio, will all but force you to show the hand of your soul. So it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to get rid of any bad vibes before 2020 \u2014 if possible, before the 26th would be ideal. That\u2019s when the new moon eclipse in Capricorn hits, and it\u2019s also when you should start drafting an outline for how you\u2019ll meet your New Years\u2019 resolutions. Venus moved into your sign on the 20th, so you can rest assured that, even if Capricorn is a season of practicality, your eccentric streak won\u2019t be tamed.\nThe sun moved into Capricorn on the 21st of December, which means it\u2019s time to get down to brass tacks about the future. Out of all the signs, you might actually be in the best position for a stable, steady manifestation of your fantasies into actual reality. Neptune is direct in Pisces, which means that the potential for wish fulfillment is at its peak. Plus, Jupiter \u2014 your other ruling planet \u2014 entered Capricorn on the 2nd of December. Jupiter in Capricorn means an air of gravitas, maturity, and strength. And you do know that Pisces is the most \u201cpsychic\u201d and intuitive sign of them all, don\u2019t you? The 26th\u2019s new moon eclipse in Capricorn is the opportune moment to work out how you\u2019ll fulfill your ambitions, just make sure that you aren\u2019t too close-minded about them. Being sensible doesn\u2019t mean you should be playing it safe. When you\u2019ve got such a good foundation for change, don\u2019t waste it by only making small moves.\nA numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing: 1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

After the massive success of Jawani Phir Nahi Aani, Janaan, Waar and Karachi Se Lahore \u2013 ARY Films is now all set for another road trip #LahoreSeAagey.\nThe promotions of Lahore Se Aagey are on full swing and the team of ARY Digital had a fun filled conversation with the cast of the movie. To get you all pumped up, we should aware you of the fact that this upcoming rom-com will certainly be your source of guffaws.\nDirector Wajahat Rauf states that if you think Lahore Se Aagey is a sequel to Karachi Se Lahore (KSL), you\u2019re mistaken. He mentioned that \u2018Lahore Se Aagey begins right where Karachi Se Lahore ended and it\u2019s basically a spinoff of KSL \u2013 being an entirely different story. The film is based on this odd couple who are travelling together to reach their respective destinations. We wonder how will that go.\nWajahat Rauf gives us some insights about him, care to know? P.S. Like us, he LOVES food!\nSpectators should certainly expect to see improved scenery, high-quality music and outstanding performance by the cast that just adds another icing on the cake!

Using experimental animals such as mice, basic research for developing an inactivated vaccine is underway.\nA group of researchers led by Masahiro Yamamoto, Professor at Research Institute for Microbial Diseases and the Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University found that p62, a host molecule, played an important role in exerting immune effects of an experimental pathogenic parasite toxoplasma-inactivated vaccine.

Electrolyte monitorin' is important in the feckin' treatment of anorexia and bulimia.\nThe word electrolyte derives from Ancient Greek \u03ae\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf- (\u0113lectro-), prefix related to electricity, and \u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (lytos), meanin' \"able to be untied or loosened\".\nIt is also possible for substances to react with water, producin' ions. Soft oul' day. For example, carbon dioxide gas dissolves in water to produce a solution that contains hydronium, carbonate, and hydrogen carbonate ions.\nAn electrolyte in a bleedin' solution may be described as \"concentrated\" if it has a bleedin' high concentration of ions, or \"diluted\" if it has a bleedin' low concentration. Story? If a feckin' high proportion of the bleedin' solute dissociates to form free ions, the oul' electrolyte is strong; if most of the solute does not dissociate, the bleedin' electrolyte is weak. Sufferin' Jaysus. The properties of electrolytes may be exploited usin' electrolysis to extract constituent elements and compounds contained within the oul' solution.\nAll known multicellular lifeforms require a bleedin' subtle and complex electrolyte balance between the intracellular and extracellular environments.[11] In particular, the feckin' maintenance of precise osmotic gradients of electrolytes is important. Such gradients affect and regulate the hydration of the body as well as blood pH, and are critical for nerve and muscle function. Various mechanisms exist in livin' species that keep the bleedin' concentrations of different electrolytes under tight control.\nBoth muscle tissue and neurons are considered electric tissues of the oul' body, game ball! Muscles and neurons are activated by electrolyte activity between the feckin' extracellular fluid or interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid, to be sure. Electrolytes may enter or leave the cell membrane through specialized protein structures embedded in the plasma membrane called \"ion channels\". Jaysis. For example, muscle contraction is dependent upon the bleedin' presence of calcium (Ca2+), sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+), you know yerself. Without sufficient levels of these key electrolytes, muscle weakness or severe muscle contractions may occur.\nElectrolyte balance is maintained by oral, or in emergencies, intravenous (IV) intake of electrolyte-containin' substances, and is regulated by hormones, in general with the bleedin' kidneys flushin' out excess levels. In humans, electrolyte homeostasis is regulated by hormones such as antidiuretic hormones, aldosterone and parathyroid hormones. Serious electrolyte disturbances, such as dehydration and overhydration, may lead to cardiac and neurological complications and, unless they are rapidly resolved, will result in a bleedin' medical emergency.\nMeasurement of electrolytes is a commonly performed diagnostic procedure, performed via blood testin' with ion-selective electrodes or urinalysis by medical technologists. The interpretation of these values is somewhat meaningless without analysis of the clinical history and is often impossible without parallel measurements of renal function. Holy blatherin' Joseph, listen to this. The electrolytes measured most often are sodium and potassium, begorrah. Chloride levels are rarely measured except for arterial blood gas interpretations since they are inherently linked to sodium levels. One important test conducted on urine is the feckin' specific gravity test to determine the bleedin' occurrence of an electrolyte imbalance.\nA home-made electrolyte drink can be made by usin' water, sugar and salt in precise proportions.[13] It is important to include glucose (sugar) to utilise the oul' co-transport mechanism of sodium and glucose, the cute hoor. Commercial preparations are also available[14] for both human and veterinary use.\nWhen electrodes are placed in an electrolyte and an oul' voltage is applied, the feckin' electrolyte will conduct electricity. Lone electrons normally cannot pass through the electrolyte; instead, a chemical reaction occurs at the oul' cathode, providin' electrons to the oul' electrolyte. Another reaction occurs at the anode, consumin' electrons from the feckin' electrolyte, to be sure. As an oul' result, a negative charge cloud develops in the oul' electrolyte around the bleedin' cathode, and a feckin' positive charge develops around the feckin' anode, would ye believe it? The ions in the oul' electrolyte neutralize these charges, enablin' the electrons to keep flowin' and the reactions to continue.\nElectrolytic cell producin' chlorine (Cl2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) from a feckin' solution of common salt.\nand chlorine gas will be liberated into solution where it reacts with the oul' sodium and hydroxyl ions to produce sodium hypochlorite - household bleach. Stop the lights! The positively charged sodium ions Na+ will react toward the bleedin' cathode, neutralizin' the oul' negative charge of OH\u2212 there, and the feckin' negatively charged hydroxide ions OH\u2212 will react toward the oul' anode, neutralizin' the feckin' positive charge of Na+ there, bedad. Without the feckin' ions from the electrolyte, the bleedin' charges around the oul' electrode would shlow down continued electron flow; diffusion of H+ and OH\u2212 through water to the oul' other electrode takes longer than movement of the bleedin' much more prevalent salt ions, you know yourself like. Electrolytes dissociate in water because water molecules are dipoles and the bleedin' dipoles orient in an energetically favorable manner to solvate the bleedin' ions.\nIn other systems, the electrode reactions can involve the metals of the feckin' electrodes as well as the ions of the bleedin' electrolyte.\nElectrolytic conductors are used in electronic devices where the chemical reaction at a feckin' metal-electrolyte interface yields useful effects.\nIn electroplatin' tanks, the bleedin' electrolyte simultaneously deposits metal onto the object to be plated, and electrically connects that object in the feckin' circuit.\nIn operation-hours gauges, two thin columns of mercury are separated by a feckin' small electrolyte-filled gap, and, as charge is passed through the bleedin' device, the oul' metal dissolves on one side and plates out on the bleedin' other, causin' the visible gap to shlowly move along.\nIn electrolytic capacitors the bleedin' chemical effect is used to produce an extremely thin dielectric or insulatin' coatin', while the feckin' electrolyte layer behaves as one capacitor plate.\nIn some hygrometers the bleedin' humidity of air is sensed by measurin' the oul' conductivity of a holy nearly dry electrolyte.\nHot, softened glass is an electrolytic conductor, and some glass manufacturers keep the feckin' glass molten by passin' an oul' large current through it.\nSolid ceramic electrolytes - ions migrate through the feckin' ceramic phase by means of vacancies or interstitials within the feckin' lattice, to be sure. There are also glassy-ceramic electrolytes.\n^ (4th ed.). New York City: Columbia University. C'mere til I tell ya now. p. 155. ISBN 978-0-231035-729.\n^ a b McHenry, Charles, ed, the cute hoor.

The dissolved electrolyte separates into cations and anions, which disperse uniformly through the bleedin' solvent. Electrically, such a feckin' solution is neutral. If an electric potential is applied to such a bleedin' solution, the feckin' cations of the solution are drawn to the electrode that has an abundance of electrons, while the feckin' anions are drawn to the oul' electrode that has a deficit of electrons. The movement of anions and cations in opposite directions within the feckin' solution amounts to an oul' current. Jaysis. This includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases. Stop the lights! Some gases, such as hydrogen chloride (HCl), under conditions of high temperature or low pressure can also function as electrolytes.[clarification needed] Electrolyte solutions can also result from the feckin' dissolution of some biological (e.g., DNA, polypeptides) and synthetic polymers (e.g., polystyrene sulfonate), termed \"polyelectrolytes\", which contain charged functional groups, grand so. A substance that dissociates into ions in solution acquires the oul' capacity to conduct electricity, be the hokey! Sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are examples of electrolytes.\nIn medicine, electrolyte replacement is needed when a feckin' person has prolonged vomitin' or diarrhea, and as a response to strenuous athletic activity. Commercial electrolyte solutions are available, particularly for sick children (such as oral rehydration solution, Suero Oral, or Pedialyte) and athletes (sports drinks). Electrolyte monitorin' is important in the feckin' treatment of anorexia and bulimia.\nThe word electrolyte derives from Ancient Greek \u03ae\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf- (\u0113lectro-), prefix related to electricity, and \u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (lytos), meanin' \"able to be untied or loosened\".\nIt is also possible for substances to react with water, producin' ions. Soft oul' day. For example, carbon dioxide gas dissolves in water to produce a solution that contains hydronium, carbonate, and hydrogen carbonate ions.\nAn electrolyte in a bleedin' solution may be described as \"concentrated\" if it has a bleedin' high concentration of ions, or \"diluted\" if it has a bleedin' low concentration. Story? If a feckin' high proportion of the bleedin' solute dissociates to form free ions, the oul' electrolyte is strong; if most of the solute does not dissociate, the bleedin' electrolyte is weak. Sufferin' Jaysus. The properties of electrolytes may be exploited usin' electrolysis to extract constituent elements and compounds contained within the oul' solution.\nAll known multicellular lifeforms require a bleedin' subtle and complex electrolyte balance between the intracellular and extracellular environments.[11] In particular, the feckin' maintenance of precise osmotic gradients of electrolytes is important. Such gradients affect and regulate the hydration of the body as well as blood pH, and are critical for nerve and muscle function. Various mechanisms exist in livin' species that keep the bleedin' concentrations of different electrolytes under tight control.\nBoth muscle tissue and neurons are considered electric tissues of the oul' body, game ball! Muscles and neurons are activated by electrolyte activity between the feckin' extracellular fluid or interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid, to be sure. Electrolytes may enter or leave the cell membrane through specialized protein structures embedded in the plasma membrane called \"ion channels\". Jaysis. For example, muscle contraction is dependent upon the bleedin' presence of calcium (Ca2+), sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+), you know yerself. Without sufficient levels of these key electrolytes, muscle weakness or severe muscle contractions may occur.\nElectrolyte balance is maintained by oral, or in emergencies, intravenous (IV) intake of electrolyte-containin' substances, and is regulated by hormones, in general with the bleedin' kidneys flushin' out excess levels. In humans, electrolyte homeostasis is regulated by hormones such as antidiuretic hormones, aldosterone and parathyroid hormones. Serious electrolyte disturbances, such as dehydration and overhydration, may lead to cardiac and neurological complications and, unless they are rapidly resolved, will result in a bleedin' medical emergency.\nMeasurement of electrolytes is a commonly performed diagnostic procedure, performed via blood testin' with ion-selective electrodes or urinalysis by medical technologists. The interpretation of these values is somewhat meaningless without analysis of the clinical history and is often impossible without parallel measurements of renal function. Holy blatherin' Joseph, listen to this. The electrolytes measured most often are sodium and potassium, begorrah. Chloride levels are rarely measured except for arterial blood gas interpretations since they are inherently linked to sodium levels. One important test conducted on urine is the feckin' specific gravity test to determine the bleedin' occurrence of an electrolyte imbalance.\nA home-made electrolyte drink can be made by usin' water, sugar and salt in precise proportions.[13] It is important to include glucose (sugar) to utilise the oul' co-transport mechanism of sodium and glucose, the cute hoor. Commercial preparations are also available[14] for both human and veterinary use.\nWhen electrodes are placed in an electrolyte and an oul' voltage is applied, the feckin' electrolyte will conduct electricity. Lone electrons normally cannot pass through the electrolyte; instead, a chemical reaction occurs at the oul' cathode, providin' electrons to the oul' electrolyte. Another reaction occurs at the anode, consumin' electrons from the feckin' electrolyte, to be sure. As an oul' result, a negative charge cloud develops in the oul' electrolyte around the bleedin' cathode, and a feckin' positive charge develops around the feckin' anode, would ye believe it? The ions in the oul' electrolyte neutralize these charges, enablin' the electrons to keep flowin' and the reactions to continue.\nElectrolytic cell producin' chlorine (Cl2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) from a feckin' solution of common salt.\nand chlorine gas will be liberated into solution where it reacts with the oul' sodium and hydroxyl ions to produce sodium hypochlorite - household bleach. Stop the lights! The positively charged sodium ions Na+ will react toward the bleedin' cathode, neutralizin' the oul' negative charge of OH\u2212 there, and the feckin' negatively charged hydroxide ions OH\u2212 will react toward the oul' anode, neutralizin' the feckin' positive charge of Na+ there, bedad. Without the feckin' ions from the electrolyte, the bleedin' charges around the oul' electrode would shlow down continued electron flow; diffusion of H+ and OH\u2212 through water to the oul' other electrode takes longer than movement of the bleedin' much more prevalent salt ions, you know yourself like. Electrolytes dissociate in water because water molecules are dipoles and the bleedin' dipoles orient in an energetically favorable manner to solvate the bleedin' ions.\nIn other systems, the electrode reactions can involve the metals of the feckin' electrodes as well as the ions of the bleedin' electrolyte.\nElectrolytic conductors are used in electronic devices where the chemical reaction at a feckin' metal-electrolyte interface yields useful effects.\nIn electroplatin' tanks, the bleedin' electrolyte simultaneously deposits metal onto the object to be plated, and electrically connects that object in the feckin' circuit.\nIn operation-hours gauges, two thin columns of mercury are separated by a feckin' small electrolyte-filled gap, and, as charge is passed through the bleedin' device, the oul' metal dissolves on one side and plates out on the bleedin' other, causin' the visible gap to shlowly move along.\nIn electrolytic capacitors the bleedin' chemical effect is used to produce an extremely thin dielectric or insulatin' coatin', while the feckin' electrolyte layer behaves as one capacitor plate.\nIn some hygrometers the bleedin' humidity of air is sensed by measurin' the oul' conductivity of a holy nearly dry electrolyte.\nHot, softened glass is an electrolytic conductor, and some glass manufacturers keep the feckin' glass molten by passin' an oul' large current through it.\nSolid ceramic electrolytes - ions migrate through the feckin' ceramic phase by means of vacancies or interstitials within the feckin' lattice, to be sure. There are also glassy-ceramic electrolytes.\n^ (4th ed.). New York City: Columbia University. C'mere til I tell ya now. p. 155. ISBN 978-0-231035-729.\n^ a b McHenry, Charles, ed, the cute hoor.

While the FDA and DEA want to say kratom produces opiate-like effects, what they fail to mention is that kratom is no where near producing the effects that morphine has on you. While it\u2019s true kratom reacts to your opiate receptors like pain pills do, these reactions are different from what high potency painkillers. In other words, kratom is not going to make you feel equal to morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone. Just due to that, it shouldn\u2019t be labeled on the same level as those drugs.\nTo understand what kratom does to you, let\u2019s take a look at what kratom is.\nKratom, also referred to by Mitragyna Speciosa, is a tropical tree that originates from Southeast Asia. Most of the kratom tree have no abilities, but the kratom leaf is special. The leaves of kratom have special compounds known as alkaloids. These alkaloids react when the kratom leaf is consumed, allowing the user to feel different effects.\nWhile the popularity of kratom has grown a lot here in the United States only in recent years, kratom has been popular in Southeast Asia for many centuries. Ancient tribes and farmers have been using kratom for a long time. The old timers would chew kratom leaves, this allowing them to put in long hours of work as one of the most well known effects of kratom is energy.\nKratom has been used for many different purposes over that span.\nSince Kratom is legal in most U.S. states, many men and women are finding this natural supplement to be extremely helpful.\nKratom can be took in many different ways.\nToss And Wash \u2013 You\u2019ve likely heard this term \u201ctoss and wash\u201d if you\u2019ve been looking into kratom at some point. It\u2019s simple but very effective as it pertains to getting your kratom in you quickly as possible. It refers to throwing your kratom powder dose in your mouth and quickly washing it down with your favorite drink.\nKratom Tea \u2013 Many kratom users choose to brew a Kratom tea, a method that has been used for centuries.\nKratom Capsules \u2013 If you\u2019ve never taken kratom before, it\u2019s no secret that the taste can certainly be an adjustment you have to make. Due to this, some Kratom users prefer taking capsules or making their own kratom pills.\nKratom Drinks \u2013 Another popular way to use kratom is creating kratom drinks, kratom shakes. Many people get creative with this, using a wide range of drinks with their kratom. From orange juice and grapefruit to strawberry milkshakes, users have found ways to mask the taste of kratom.\nSmoking Kratom \u2013 Why I don\u2019t personally smoke kratom myself, some users do and they like it.\nThere\u2019s a lot of politics being played with kratom.\nThey want to ban kratom. However, kratom is not an opiate. Not even close.\nNot only is kratom not as powerful as opioids, kratom is not as addictive as them either. In fact, studies and research have revealed that kratom compounds only bind to opioid receptors partially.\nAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard, the opioid epidemic is real. It\u2019s a tragedy and took 49,000 lives in 2017. Due to the backlash, doctors have become scared to write opiates to patients. I can\u2019t blame them, I\u2019d be scared too. However, some people need pain pills and many can\u2019t get them legally. Due to this, men and women are looking for help, kratom has been there as an option to help users cope with their pain.\nNow, kratom is known for helping people with opiate withdrawal symptoms and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.\nKratom is natural, it\u2019s not a manufactured compound that you\u2019ll find in nearly all drugs. It\u2019s nowhere close.\nWhen you break down the scientific facts between kratom and opioids, they don\u2019t compare. That\u2019s just a fact.\nThanks to the support of the American Kratom Association and the growing kratom community, a lot is being done to bring science into the equation. All of us that rely on kratom should be thankful for that support.\nWe still have mountains to climb, valleys to conquer, the battle to keep kratom legal is never ending.\nI will always be a loud kratom supporter as it has changed my life for the better.

He\u2019s a retired racing greyhound and had a terrible coat when he came off the track. As you can see he was missing a good portion of the fur on his thighs as well as his butt and stomach. I tried everything to get his fur to grow back in with no luck until I came across your product. His fur started growing back after only a few weeks and was fully filled in after a few months. Everyone comments on how gorgeous and silky his coat is.
