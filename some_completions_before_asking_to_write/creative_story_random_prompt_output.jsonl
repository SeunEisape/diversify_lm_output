What are the consequences of that?\nDr. Singleton: \u201cGag orders\u201d result from contracts that physicians are forced to sign in order to provide care to patients, even though the gag order may violate their rights as a person and as a physician. The gag order is an example of what happens when a doctor\u2019s right to free speech in this country is taken away. The First Amendment protects the freedom of expression, which includes freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\nPhysicians are held to a higher standard in that we are prohibited from lying in court or in the courtroom. For example, if you are a physician in a court case, and the attorney of a plaintiff or a defendant calls you to the stand, and you can\u2019t answer the question, that is a violation of the First Amendment and the doctor is exposed to civil penalties and can lose their medical license.\nPhysicians have the right to free speech unless they are in a courtroom or on the witness stand. As a patient, I would hope that my physician would not be threatened or gagged if I sought legal advice and gave permission for my physician to talk about my case.\nIn addition, physicians may use anonymized cases in teaching sessions, journal articles, or even a book. The only way that gag orders can be challenged is if there is a physician who is willing to go to court and get a declaratory judgment to defend those rights, and few are willing to do so. We are only beginning to get a handle on just how prevalent gag orders are in medicine.\nWe do know this: There are over 10,000 gag orders in the United States, and that represents just the tip of the iceberg because some doctors comply out of fear that they could be disciplined or lose their medical license. For example, recently one doctor in a hospital system was disciplined and fired because she shared information with a patient. The patient sued, and the hospital settled.\nWe are not aware of a case in the U.S. where an institutional employer has been held accountable when a gag order is violated and the employee has lost his or her medical license. If I were a physician, I would not want to be sued when my actions are completely protected by law as long as I\u2019m not on the witness stand. So why do physicians accept gag orders?

Zainab's side of the story is believable and Tonto's ex should have been on the defensive for having a girlfriend that he claims she never knew. He should have been ashamed of her because all she wanted was the relationship they had to end in marriage.

Should we invest? When should we invest?\u201d With the pandemic causing so much uncertainty throughout 2020 and 2021, the answer wasn\u2019t necessarily clear. However, because banks and governments have kept interest rates and lending rates low to help protect the economy, many investors and first-time buyers have found that it is the perfect opportunity to take advantage. From an investment property venture to buying or selling a principal residence, now is one of the best times to be in the market..\nRead on to learn a little bit more about Calgary House Finder, and how their knowledge of the current market trends and home prices can help you decide whether or not you want to invest in Calgary\u2019s growing economy.\nJust north of the border with the United States, Calgary is located in the province of Alberta on the eastern side of Canada. It is Alberta\u2019s largest city and the fourth-largest city in the country. Record-high oil prices led to a surge in Calgary\u2019s economy in recent years, attracting many immigrants from around the world and adding to the city\u2019s value. However, more recently Calgary\u2019s economy has been in a slump, partially due to the reduction in demand for oil.\nStill, the city is continually developing, providing housing and many opportunities for its residents. With the health, education, and business sectors growing, and the real estate market on fire as we wind down into the final stages of the pandemic, more and more high-earning professionals are moving (or returning) to Calgary.\nThe city isn\u2019t far behind Toronto in having the second-highest concentration of headquarter offices. This means that companies are here to stay. And the city\u2019s landscape keeps residents and visitors healthy and entertained with annual festivals, expansive parks and wetlands, the Bow River, and exploration of the nearby Canadian Rockies.\nThe city has an appreciable amount of culture, including musical theatres, various museums, restaurants that serve cuisine from around the world, and Canada\u2019s Sports Hall of Fame. So is Calgary a good place to invest in real estate? It sure is!\nOur real estate professionals can help you search for Calgary houses for sale, so come join us!\nHow is the Calgary Real Estate Market?\nEven with COVID-19 still an issue, the market is doing well, and buyer and seller confidence is up. People have come to see that they can still buy and sell property via online and limited in-person contact.\nConsequently, sellers who had delayed posting their home\u2019s listing have taken the plunge in 2021 while buyers are taking advantage of low lending rates and improved savings. Case in point: March 2021 saw the highest number of sales in over a decade.\nIf you\u2019re a real estate investor or looking to become one, now is the time to stop shopping and start investing. There are many affordable deals available, from rental properties to single-family homes that will pay off later down the road.\nPro: The long-term need for space due to more individuals working from home may affect demand patterns within the housing market, leading to a potentially stronger sales growth.\nPro: There is potential for a stronger demand growth from first-time buyers since the market is expectedto experience price declines and lower lending rates.\nCon: COVID-19\u2019s presence still causes uncertainty related to the time it will take for the economy to recover and the effects long-term unemployment and business bankruptcies will have.\nCon: Alberta\u2019s growing number of mortgage deferrals could affect supply levels in the market.\nCalgary House Finder keeps track of market trends and investment opportunities, so get in touch with us to determine the right investment property for you.\nIs Calgary a Buyers\u2019 or Sellers\u2019 Market?\nIn the northwest part of the city, consider checking out our Evanston homes for sale. Of course, you don\u2019t want to be limited to just the Evanston neighborhood, so feel free to jump into the houses for sale in Calgary NE, or browse the houses for sale in Calgary NW.\nNote: The benchmark price is the price forecasted for a general type of home within a certain area.\nFor a proper investigation of Alberta real estate investment options, consult our team.\nDepending on their situation, investors should evaluate a few real estate aspects before diving into an investment like a rental property.\nRent: Perform due diligence on the average rental rates for each region you\u2019re interested in. This rental income should cover things like mortgage payment, property insurance and taxes.\nProperty Taxes: Investigate the current market value assessments of property taxes. If they\u2019re high, find out why and if it\u2019s worth investing in the long run.\nCondo Fees: You want to avoid profit-limiting costs when browsing condominiums, so you need to do a proper investigation. This type of rental property is subject to occupancy fee or \u201cphantom rent.\u201d Buyers pay occupancy fees to the developer prior to the time you take ownership of the investment property.\nEmployment: COVID-19 has caused a high level of unemployment, so choosing a property that\u2019s in a growing job market means that you\u2019ll have tenants in no time, especially if you\u2019re near educational institutions and new businesses.

I watched it. During the various interviews, one particular diner owner explains how Mulder ordered a piece of sweet potato pie; with each piece he would ask one question. On eating the entire pie, he pays and leaves. For whatever reason, I wanted to eat that pie. In the UK we have pork pies, apple pies (not as American and Americans would have you believe) and all sorts but as the sweet potato (or yam, whatever you want to call it) is not popular here, we have no sweet potato pie on offer. June 2004, Dallas, Texas; whilst trying to avoid a guy trying to lift my spirits by inviting me to a 'titty bar' before my flight, I came across the famed Southern pie. I politely ordered a slice, sat and prepared myself for such exquisite bliss. It was horrible. I'm sorry, sweet potatoes, in pie form or otherwise, are not to my liking at all. The pie itself was incredibly sweet and curiously textured but all together wrong. So when presented with a film about Southern pies, all I could think was, sure, it looks tasty but I bet I would hate it. The same could be said for the trailer of this film; looked promising but failed to deliver.\nThe film's opening sequence is pleasant enough, setting the story into quick motion; take one 'genius' pie maker, add one pregnancy test, two high-voiced sidekick buddies and top with a grumpy boss for good measure. As the film progresses, we discover our lead waitress, Jenna (played by Keri Russell, whom I have never particularly liked), has no intention of aborting the baby but she isn't best pleased about having it. She has an obsessive, obnoxious, semi-abusive husband, a job that pays very little, friends who seem to like her but not overly, little prospects and no money. All that she has going for her is the ability to create pies; considering the phrase goes, \"as easy as pie\" I can't imagine that's a difficult thing to do. Upon visiting her GP, she discovers that her regular doctor has been replaced by Doctor Pomatter [Fillion] from Connecticut. He's shy and nervous, stumbling in and out of conversations but for whatever reason, impulsiveness takes hold of Jenna and she launches herself onto him. So, now we have a pregnant waitress having an affair with her married doctor and I'm still sitting in the cinema, forty five minutes in, waiting for something funny to happen in this award-winning, highly-praised comedy.\nThere are two key flaws to this piece and they are two which cannot be overlooked and ultimately bring down this film. The first is genre and tone; this film has no idea what it's supposed to be. The script dances back and forth between comedy, romance and drama without consequence, unable to decide what to settle with. Whenever the story becomes slightly funny or quirky, a dose of domestic violence is added to boost the dramatic reality. Having caught our audience off guard, we start to empathise with our lead, only to have it undercut by a comical one-liner. Back in the comedy realm, we are offered the foppish, nervous doctor who wants nothing more than to make Jenna happy, compliment her and learn how to cook pies; cue the romance.  I know my arguing that point may sound ridiculous, as if I haven't the ability to process a multi-layered feature; however, I am simply trying to explain that the transitional elements used to span the genres were poorly executed. The second issue is with the characters themselves, there are two categories that each can be filed into; men and women. It's that simple. The women are all oppressed by the men around them but keep their spirits up, Jenna has her scummy husband, Dawn [Shelly] has a crazy stalker boyfriend and low self-esteem and Becky [Hines] is married to an invalid and having an affair. The men are all hollow and two dimensional.  Each character has a single trait that they play to death, they have one redeeming moment but no visible arc; the whole formula pissed me off. It reminded me of Bridget Jones' Diary, in which all men are arseholes and all women, despite immoral acts, are forgiven. I know this sounds a bit like some uppity bloke is annoyed at a pro-feminist film but I assure you, it's just this pro-feminist film.\nI would like to take a quick moment and spoil the end of this film for everyone, so by all means skip ahead to the next paragraph. I hated the ending. For some reason almost everyone is present during or shortly after the birth.  In this moment she sees her doctor lover and his happy, trusting young wife, she finds the courage to confront and divorce her husband and manages to make a bundle of cash out of the old man's kindness and subsequent comatose state. Shortly after this we are subjected to some of the worst, sickly sweet final moments; Jenna loves the baby girl, who grows up hassle and trauma free, making pies with her mother. In addition to this, she buys the diner, paints the walls, changes the uniforms and renames the place - I imagine Old Joe died and didn't want a legacy or anything like that. The affair with the doctor is also dealt with in the same cold clinical manner, apparently they never see each other again or something and he simply accepts the fact that it's over despite being willing to pack up and leave moments before; it's all far too rushed and too damned neat. I have theories about the whole offering of the moon pie at the end and how it might have been an attempt at a deep, underlying meaning but I doubt it, besides, where does a woman who has just given birth get a pre-packaged pie? The upbeat, positive dismissal of anything the plot set out to achieve was completely dismissed for a really sappy ending. I wasn't the only one sighing in the audience but I seemed to be the only one rolling my eyes... mine was more of an exhaustive huff than a pleased sigh. I couldn't help but leave the cinema mutter \"Well, that just sums up the South, a bunch of pregnant waitresses becoming single mothers and it's portrayed as a positive thing.\" Yes, that was uncalled for and rude of me and this film is an exception because this waitress has her own diner and everything works out well. \nThere are, despite my bashing, a few positive points that should be addressed. The cinematography was interesting, as were the pie day-dreams, in which Jenna created a new pie to fit her circumstance. As a Fillion fan, I enjoyed his scenes and found the bumbling doctor entertaining to start with but somewhat put off toward the end; after all, he's having an affair and we're only introduced to his loving wife in the closing ten minutes. The scenes with Ogie and Dawn were also quite entertaining but for all the wrong reasons. They started off well, he was creepy and obsessed, she had low self-esteem and didn't want anything to do with him... but then they got married. I just.. I really can't explain that one (in future, Jemison, stick with Danny Ocean). Essentially, this film isn't that bad but equally it's not that good either. Leaving the cinema, I was somewhat indifferent to the whole thing but looking back, I now realise that I didn't like it. It's still an averagely viewable film but I imagine it will probably join Steel Magnolias and Terms Of Endearment in the annals of DVDs for heartbroken girls who want a mushy, 'no guys allowed' night-in; I would recommend Thelma & Louise for that sort of thing. I know it's grim to suggest but I think one of the main reasons it got picked up and acclaimed was due to the fact that it was released shortly after Shelly's death in 2006. As I said, it's a horrid thing to say but I genuinely don't think this film is half as good as everyone is making it out to be but cannot bring themselves to critic someone who died in such a horrific way - maybe it's just me, who knows?\nI must confess, despite my sweet potato pie incident, the (largely chocolate based) pies featured in the film did look incredibly appetising. On top of that, the day-dream sequences, in which Jenna creates her 'I Don't Want Earl's Baby Pie,' 'Earl Murders Me Because I'm Having An Affair Pie' and 'I Can't Have No Affair Because It's Wrong And I Don't Want Earl To Kill Me Pie' are quite inventive and take a nice break from the gritty realism of the world of road-side catering HA HA HA... only kidding. Seriously though, I did enjoy the birth of each oddly named pie.\nAndy Griffith's portrayal of Old Joe is one that will be vastly overlooked. Of all the horrible men, his nastiness is purely surface based and he's simply lived a long life and learned that there are few people worth caring about; sort of.

The same could be said for the trailer of this film; looked promising but failed to deliver.\nThe film's opening sequence is pleasant enough, setting the story into quick motion; take one 'genius' pie maker, add one pregnancy test, two high-voiced sidekick buddies and top with a grumpy boss for good measure. As the film progresses, we discover our lead waitress, Jenna (played by Keri Russell, whom I have never particularly liked), has no intention of aborting the baby but she isn't best pleased about having it. She has an obsessive, obnoxious, semi-abusive husband, a job that pays very little, friends who seem to like her but not overly, little prospects and no money. All that she has going for her is the ability to create pies; considering the phrase goes, \"as easy as pie\" I can't imagine that's a difficult thing to do. Upon visiting her GP, she discovers that her regular doctor has been replaced by Doctor Pomatter [Fillion] from Connecticut. He's shy and nervous, stumbling in and out of conversations but for whatever reason, impulsiveness takes hold of Jenna and she launches herself onto him. So, now we have a pregnant waitress having an affair with her married doctor and I'm still sitting in the cinema, forty five minutes in, waiting for something funny to happen in this award-winning, highly-praised comedy.\nThere are two key flaws to this piece and they are two which cannot be overlooked and ultimately bring down this film. The first is genre and tone; this film has no idea what it's supposed to be. The script dances back and forth between comedy, romance and drama without consequence, unable to decide what to settle with. Whenever the story becomes slightly funny or quirky, a dose of domestic violence is added to boost the dramatic reality. Having caught our audience off guard, we start to empathise with our lead, only to have it undercut by a comical one-liner. Back in the comedy realm, we are offered the foppish, nervous doctor who wants nothing more than to make Jenna happy, compliment her and learn how to cook pies; cue the romance.  I know my arguing that point may sound ridiculous, as if I haven't the ability to process a multi-layered feature; however, I am simply trying to explain that the transitional elements used to span the genres were poorly executed. The second issue is with the characters themselves, there are two categories that each can be filed into; men and women. It's that simple. The women are all oppressed by the men around them but keep their spirits up, Jenna has her scummy husband, Dawn [Shelly] has a crazy stalker boyfriend and low self-esteem and Becky [Hines] is married to an invalid and having an affair. The men are all hollow and two dimensional.  Each character has a single trait that they play to death, they have one redeeming moment but no visible arc; the whole formula pissed me off. It reminded me of Bridget Jones' Diary, in which all men are arseholes and all women, despite immoral acts, are forgiven. I know this sounds a bit like some uppity bloke is annoyed at a pro-feminist film but I assure you, it's just this pro-feminist film.\nI would like to take a quick moment and spoil the end of this film for everyone, so by all means skip ahead to the next paragraph. I hated the ending. For some reason almost everyone is present during or shortly after the birth.  In this moment she sees her doctor lover and his happy, trusting young wife, she finds the courage to confront and divorce her husband and manages to make a bundle of cash out of the old man's kindness and subsequent comatose state. Shortly after this we are subjected to some of the worst, sickly sweet final moments; Jenna loves the baby girl, who grows up hassle and trauma free, making pies with her mother. In addition to this, she buys the diner, paints the walls, changes the uniforms and renames the place - I imagine Old Joe died and didn't want a legacy or anything like that. The affair with the doctor is also dealt with in the same cold clinical manner, apparently they never see each other again or something and he simply accepts the fact that it's over despite being willing to pack up and leave moments before; it's all far too rushed and too damned neat. I have theories about the whole offering of the moon pie at the end and how it might have been an attempt at a deep, underlying meaning but I doubt it, besides, where does a woman who has just given birth get a pre-packaged pie? The upbeat, positive dismissal of anything the plot set out to achieve was completely dismissed for a really sappy ending. I wasn't the only one sighing in the audience but I seemed to be the only one rolling my eyes... mine was more of an exhaustive huff than a pleased sigh. I couldn't help but leave the cinema mutter \"Well, that just sums up the South, a bunch of pregnant waitresses becoming single mothers and it's portrayed as a positive thing.\" Yes, that was uncalled for and rude of me and this film is an exception because this waitress has her own diner and everything works out well. \nThere are, despite my bashing, a few positive points that should be addressed. The cinematography was interesting, as were the pie day-dreams, in which Jenna created a new pie to fit her circumstance. As a Fillion fan, I enjoyed his scenes and found the bumbling doctor entertaining to start with but somewhat put off toward the end; after all, he's having an affair and we're only introduced to his loving wife in the closing ten minutes. The scenes with Ogie and Dawn were also quite entertaining but for all the wrong reasons. They started off well, he was creepy and obsessed, she had low self-esteem and didn't want anything to do with him... but then they got married. I just.. I really can't explain that one (in future, Jemison, stick with Danny Ocean). Essentially, this film isn't that bad but equally it's not that good either. Leaving the cinema, I was somewhat indifferent to the whole thing but looking back, I now realise that I didn't like it. It's still an averagely viewable film but I imagine it will probably join Steel Magnolias and Terms Of Endearment in the annals of DVDs for heartbroken girls who want a mushy, 'no guys allowed' night-in; I would recommend Thelma & Louise for that sort of thing. I know it's grim to suggest but I think one of the main reasons it got picked up and acclaimed was due to the fact that it was released shortly after Shelly's death in 2006. As I said, it's a horrid thing to say but I genuinely don't think this film is half as good as everyone is making it out to be but cannot bring themselves to critic someone who died in such a horrific way - maybe it's just me, who knows?\nI must confess, despite my sweet potato pie incident, the (largely chocolate based) pies featured in the film did look incredibly appetising. On top of that, the day-dream sequences, in which Jenna creates her 'I Don't Want Earl's Baby Pie,' 'Earl Murders Me Because I'm Having An Affair Pie' and 'I Can't Have No Affair Because It's Wrong And I Don't Want Earl To Kill Me Pie' are quite inventive and take a nice break from the gritty realism of the world of road-side catering HA HA HA... only kidding. Seriously though, I did enjoy the birth of each oddly named pie.\nAndy Griffith's portrayal of Old Joe is one that will be vastly overlooked. Of all the horrible men, his nastiness is purely surface based and he's simply lived a long life and learned that there are few people worth caring about; sort of. The performance is well acted (hardly surprising, considering it's Griffith) and listening to him lecture Jenna by reading her their shared horoscope was pretty funny.\n\"'Dear Elizabeth, can you help me write the perfect suicide note so that my snake husband and his slut girlfriend will feel sufficiently guilty?' Then Elizabeth goes onto to offer some nonsense about how suicide is never the answer. Oh, how I love living vicariously through the pain of others\"\n\"Take one mediocre script, layer with stereotypical characters add a thick helping of pro-feminist man hating and heat for 107 minutes before serving without cream. Mmm... bland overrated film pie; my favourite\"\ncreative_storyteller\nThis movie is funny! For all of you who didn't like it, it's a Southern satire, and if you don't have the slightest idea about the South you should look it up before you say anything about this movie. \nThere are many reasons for you not to like this movie. Jenna's pregnancy, that is just a tool for her to learn to stand up for herself and not let anyone push her around. Jenna's affair, a means for her to feel loved, for someone to look out for her. Jenna's divorce and career changes, it's a journey to happiness and she gets there, but she's strong and not without mistakes. \nThis is not a bad thing. This is a great message. That women are strong and they can do things for themselves. That women should look after themselves and love themselves. \nI'm sorry that I got a little emotional, and maybe it's because I'm Southern and I was born into a strong woman who worked hard to support her family. Maybe it's because she is the one that made me who I am, and that means I'm strong and can do things for myself. Maybe it's just because the movie's a Southern satire about a Southern woman finding herself and how strong she really is. \nI don't care if it didn't seem real, I don't care if you didn't like it. But this was a great movie. It had me laughing the whole time, it made me think, and it made me cry. I recommend it to anyone.", "completion_only": "teller\nThis movie is funny!

You must first learn how to craft an attention grabbing story that does more than just fill in some air time. You want to use the power of story to share compelling information that makes a difference. Here are the steps to do just that\u2026\n\n1. Identify and communicate the core values of your business.\n\nWhat are the values your business represents? What do you stand for? How are you different? What are your strengths?\n\nAs an example, I\u2019ve found that all of my clients are really big on helping others. They want to make the world a better place. When you can convey this with passion, it is irresistible.\n\n2. Identify one or two stories that exemplify this value.\n\nWhat is something that happened in your past or a current event that really shows your core values. Make sure you use the words \u201cas I was driving in my car this morning\u201d or \u201cthis story just happened to me the other day.\u201d This makes it a personal experience. People will connect with it if you can relate to them.\n\nOne time a client told a story about a young child who was in the hospital in pain, and how her business was able to make a difference by providing an incredible gift to that child and their family. This story was truly moving.\n\n3. Practice the story out loud!\n\nYou must practice the story out loud to get the pacing and rhythm right. You must have a flow. When you have a flow, it will feel natural. You will feel more comfortable with this story. A story told with passion is magnetic. Just like I was just sharing in point #2 above.\n\nIf you are a bit shy, or you are not confident with public speaking, just keep on practicing until it feels comfortable. When you practice out loud, it does get comfortable! I have been practicing out loud for over ten years. Now I can tell a story with any information and any core value.\n\nAnother client told a story about an organization he was doing some work for. He was driving out to a location and he was listening to his Ipod. As he got closer, the music became more upbeat. He really enjoyed this song he hadn\u2019t heard in awhile.

Easter charged the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure (CAFT) as follows: \u201cto determine whether the process leading to the decision followed Departmental and College policies and also if the decision to discontinue Dr. [Kenneth] Howell\u2019s adjunct appointment did indeed constitute a violation of academic freedom.\u201d Toward that end and pursuant to its rules CAFT appointed the undersigned subcommittee to inquire and report to the Committee. The subcommittee met with: Professor Robert McKim, at the time of the events under investigation the head of the Department of Religion in the School of Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS); Ann Mester, Associate Dean of LAS; Ruth Watkins, Dean of LAS; Steven Veazie, Esq., Campus Legal Counsel; and Dr. Howell (who was accompanied by his legal counsel and a monsignor of the Roman Catholic Church). All those interviewed were most cooperative and we are indebted for their candor.\nWhat follows will summarize the events under investigation the basic facts of which are not in dispute. We will then state what we see as the issues these events present and will analyze them from the perspective of university policy and sound academic practice. At the close, we will offer some recommendations for future action.\nIndividuals will be proposed for adjunct faculty status by the Newman Foundation, and shall hold appropriate scholarly credentials and shall be reviewed and approved for adjunct status according to the standard procedures for such positions. The faculty members and courses shall be subject to the same review and supervision by the Program for the Study of Religion as apply to all courses and members of the Program\u2019s faculty. In turn, the adjunct faculty affiliated with the Newman Foundation shall have the rights and privileges accorded all faculty holding the same positions.\nAccording to Professor McKim, at that point from the department\u2019s perspective the glass became \u201chalf full\u201d: the department was pleased that it and LAS had assumed oversight of course content but, despite the requirement of departmental review and approval of the adjunct instructors submitted by the Newman Foundation, for practical purposes, in the department\u2019s view, the Newman Foundation continued to retain control over the designation of instructional staff. The department understood Dr. Howell, who had taught those courses for several years without faculty review of his teaching and without formal consideration of his continuance, to be, in effect, a legacy of the prior arrangement. As will appear in the discussion to follow, while his syllabi were approved the actual practice of his teaching was never formally evaluated; there was never formal departmental review attendant to a decision to continue-or discontinue-his appointment. It was simply assumed that he would continue from year to year, and he did. Toward the end of the Spring 2010 semester, i.e., at the time of the event in question, his course, Introduction to Catholicism 127, was listed for the Fall 2010 semester under his instruction.\nIn May, 2010, a student e-mailed a message to Professor McKim relaying and enclosing a complaint about Dr. Howell from a student in Howell\u2019s class on Introduction to Catholicism. The student attached an e-mail message from Dr. Howell to that class, sent in preparation for the final examination, which formed the basis for the student\u2019s complaint. It is appended to this report.\nProfessor McKim was deeply disturbed by Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail on three grounds: (1) that the treatment of utilitarianism was \u201cunprofessional,\u201d i.e., he considered Howell\u2019s discussion of consent to be out of place and his treatment of consequentialism to distort the idea that he was supposed to be explaining; (2) that the treatment of homosexuality in natural moral law lacked intellectual \u201cdistance,\u201d i.e., to Professor McKim it purveyed what the Church believes to be true as an incontrovertable truth presented as such and, as presented, i.e., as a matter that the students are ill-equipped independently to question, to suggest that the students accept the instructor\u2019s assertion of what the truth is; and, (3) that the treatment of homosexuality evidenced \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in that it could be expected to and did offend, as evidenced in the student\u2019s protest, especially his comments on the assumption of the sexual roles of the male and female in homosexual intercourse and the medical aspects of homosexual sex based upon a single anecdotal reference.\nProfessor McKim shared Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail with three senior colleagues who composed the department\u2019s promotion and tenure committee as well as with a fourth because of the latter\u2019s disciplinary expertise in Christianity. One found the e-mail to evidence professional incompetence to such an extent as to warrant termination. One suggested that Prof. McKim explore with Dr. Howell whether he, Howell, did not think the message unacceptable and why. A third said that the relationship with the Newman Foundation should be terminated which the Committee takes to intend a termination of Dr. Howell\u2019s relationship to the department as well. Professor McKim also discussed the e-mail with Professor Douglas Kibbee, Director of the School of Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics, who did not address the content of the message, and with Ann Mester, Associate Dean of LAS.\nProfessor McKim told the subcommittee that, as deeply disturbed as he was by Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail, he had not yet decided on a course of action but that Associate Dean Mester, as advised by campus counsel, was of the view that Howell ought not be continued. This, he understood, arose out of concern that the university might be sued by \u201cthe gay community\u201d over the tenor of Howell\u2019s remarks. More broadly, he told the committee, he was concerned about Howell\u2019s \u201con-going\u201d and \u201csystematic\u201d crossing of the \u201cboundary\u201d between teaching and indoctrination (though he acknowledged that this was mainly conversational evidence with students\u2013the department had not formally documented this). Dean Mester told the committee that she was concerned about the e-mail\u2019s content: primarily by its treatment of Catholic thought, as embodying a truth that the students were ill-equipped to question, which she regarded as a closing off of debate on what should be a debatable subject; but also by the possibility that the e-mail could create a hostile atmosphere for gay and bisexual students. She consulted Dean Watkins who advised her to consult campus counsel. In Mester\u2019s view, confirmed by campus counsel, there was no obligation to continue Dr. Howell as an adjunct; in fact, as he was not to be paid by the university he was not, in her view, even an employee of the University. She informed the committee that the appointment of another adjunct (whose name need not be mentioned) had been similarly discontinued summarily for \u201cinappropriate teaching\u201d without incident.\nDean Mester was eventually able to discuss the matter with campus counsel Stephen Veazie. According to Veazie, he did not advise termination, but he saw no problem with terminating Dr. Howell\u2019s relationship so long as no apology on the department or university\u2019s part was made which might have implied institutional acceptance of responsibility for Howell\u2019s e-mail message. Mester told the undersigned that she informed Prof. McKim that he was free to act as he saw best so long as he addressed counsel\u2019s caution. In sum, Dean Mester, as the \u201cpoint person\u201d from the administration\u2019s perspective at this time, understood that she was transmitting a \u201cconsensus view\u201d endorsing the course of action that Professor McKim was advocating. Professor McKim understood that this option, which he was leaning toward, was being strongly encouraged if not actually ordered by the administration.\nProfessor McKim met with Dr. Howell to ascertain if the content of the e-mail was accurate: if he had transmitted it and whether it was the text he had transmitted. If so, he had decided to inform Howell that his appointment would not be continued. Howell confirmed the accuracy of the text and McKim informed Howell of his decision. According to Prof. McKim, he briefly canvassed the reasons for this action: that students would, rightly, be disturbed by his treatment of homosexuality, of the examples Howell had used; that it was insensitive and embarrassing. That Howell\u2019s treatment of utilitarianism was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d (to which Howell said, \u201cyou [meaning McKim in a personal sense] would have caught this\u201d). And that his presentation of moral natural law \u201clacked distance.\u201d Initially, McKim stated, Howell did not understand that he was being terminated. Howell said they\u2019d talk more about it upon their respective return from foreign travels. So McKim had emphatically to inform Howell that he would not be returned to teaching in the Fall. Insofar as the department was concerned that is where the matter rested.\nDr. Howell remembers this conversation a little differently. He did not recall his treatment of utilitarianism to have been a subject of discussion. Prof. McKim\u2019s primary concern was for the \u201cdamage\u201d Howell\u2019s treatment of homosexuality might cause the department and the university. McKim stated that the department had an interest in not offending students to which Howell replied that his role was not to make students \u201cfeel good\u201d but to get them to think. Nevertheless, McKim asserted that on issues of special sensitivity one \u201chas to be very careful.\u201d The conversation proceeded on to the e-mail\u2019s treatment of moral natural law. Howell believed that McKim\u2019s personal pedagogical style, as is that of others in the department, is to decline to state his own conclusions. Howell\u2019s approach is different: he is candid about his beliefs, but he insisted that he does not require students to accept his position. In other words, he draws a distinction between permissible advocacy and impermissible indoctrination. The Committee pressed him on the ground that his e-mail message could be read to state that as the teachings of moral natural law on human sexuality were grounded in \u201creality\u201d and not in Church doctrine, a fair implication was that the students would be expected to agree with it-for who could contest an obvious reality of the natural world?-and, indeed, were admonished that they lacked the intellectual training to contest it. Dr. Howell stated that he was presenting the Church\u2019s view of the truth as the Church\u2019s view, not as truth in itself; and that his observation about the lack of student research grounding was meant to stimulate just such a student effort at independent research and thought. Dr. Howell was emphatic in his statements to the Committee that his role was to encourage critical thought, not to instill doctrine.\nDr. Howell confirmed that he left the meeting with Prof. McKim thinking the matter an open one. After McKim made it clear that Howell had been terminated he sought legal counsel from the Alliance Defense Fund.\nThe decision became the subject of public controversy not only surrounding Dr. Howell\u2019s termination but also in regard to the relationship of the Department of Religion to the Newman Foundation. On the former, the public controversy, letters were received by the administration from the Alliance Defense Fund on behalf of Dr. Howell and from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), which made what the Committee takes to be a thinly veiled threat of litigation. A meeting was held in mid-July involving a number of high-level administrators the result of which was a decision to offer Dr. Howell an appointment for the Fall semester. Professor McKim was informed of this decision. He did not agree with it; but, as the matter was out of his hands, he was in no position other than to state his lack of concurrence. There is no dispute that this decision was influenced by the university\u2019s concern over a possible lawsuit-the absence of any documented record of Dr. Howell\u2019s lack of professionalism in teaching would fare badly in defending that ground as a valid ground of action-and by the procedural concern that it would be better to maintain the status quo ante whilst the academic freedom issues were to be sorted out by the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure. Dr. Howell accepted appointment offered for the Fall 2010 semester.\nOn the latter, the relationship with the Newman Foundation, negotiations commenced with the Foundation and the Diocese of Peoria culminating in an agreement amicably arrived at in late July to terminate the arrangement with the Foundation. Henceforth, adjunct appointments in the Department of Religion would be made by the department through its process for appointment and renewal and the adjunct appointees paid by the university.\nIn this case issues of procedure and of substance are closely intertwined. It is necessary to separate them for analytical purposes.\nEach academic unit is thus at liberty to act as it will with respect to such appointees and, not surprisingly, practice varies widely. In the History Department adjuncts (and other non-tenure track appointees) have their teaching subject to peer evaluation, usually annually, have their ICES scores reviewed by the department chair and are counseled by the chair in consultation with the executive committee if concerns about the quality of teaching surface. The College of Law does not require in-class review of adjuncts. The appointment of adjunct faculty is vetted by the College\u2019s appointments committee subject to oversight by the faculty as a whole. Review thereafter is done by the Associate Dean, primarily on the basis of ICES scores and student comment. Underperforming adjunct faculty may be counseled in order to improve or simply not offered teaching assignments in the future. In the Department of Religion the head received the ICES reports on Dr. Howell, in recent years the department\u2019s only adjunct teacher, but no other review was undertaken and, as Dr. Howell had favorable ICES scores, his continuance was assumed as a matter of course requiring no further collegial action. As Professor McKim noted, the relationship with the Newman Center and Dr. Howell was felt as a fait accompli.\nThis regulatory vacuum abetted the difficulty the department encountered in the wake of Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail. As the foregoing summary indicates, there was a degree of uncertainty about just what his relationship to the department was at that time. The administration, as advised by legal counsel, took the position that he was either a prospective employee or, even in his current adjunct status, one who could be continued or not at the university\u2019s discretion. It is not obvious to the Committee that that was so. Dr. Howell had held the title of Adjunct Associate Professor for many years, had taught continuously without official notice of renewal, had expected to teach Introduction to Roman Catholicism, as did the department, and had been listed as teaching that offering in the Fall. By academic rather than legal standards a persuasive argument could be made that his summary removal from the course assigned in the Fall because of the content of his e-mail was a dismissal on which he should have been afforded academic due process.3 Thus the episode draws attention to a significant lacuna in the university\u2019s regulations and one that is likely to become more vexing the more this university, as do many others, comes to rely on contingent faculty to assume a larger share of teaching. We will recommend a corrective course at the close.\nInasmuch as Dr. Howell has been reinstated, the Committee\u2019s observations on his message to his students are intended for guidance in future. At the threshold, however, the standard to be applied to that communication needs be addressed.\nOn the one hand, in the give-and-take of classroom discussion and debate impromptu analogies or metaphors may be uttered or ideas essayed spontaneously that may be offensive to some but which may nevertheless serve a sound pedagogical purpose-to stimulate, instigate, or prod students to think critically about the matter at hand or to think skeptically about a disciplinary proposition. Such remarks are intensely context-specific: as they draw sustenance and immediacy from the chemistry of the class such passing remarks, when laid upon a bare page and taken in the abstract, may well be misunderstood. On the other hand, professional publications should be expected to have been well worked through; they are laid upon a bare page and are held up for critical assessment by professional standards of scholarly care.\nDr. Howell\u2019s e-mail was sent to students in Religion 127-and copied to students in a more advanced course-to dispel their confusion about how utilitarianism as an ethical system related to moral natural law. Though it does not bear all the earmarks of a finely wrought professional exercise it is more like a thought-through professional exposition than an impromptu classroom expostulation and we shall treat it as such. And as such we need to consider the three problematical aspects identified by Professor McKim and the Associate Dean of LAS.\n1. Utilitarianism. Professor McKim, in consultation with other senior faculty in the department, believed Professor Howell\u2019s explanation of utilitarianism to have been woefully deficient to the point even of questioning Howell\u2019s professional competence. Obviously, a manifest failure to comprehend the subject or to explain it accurately is not sheltered by academic freedom; and Professor McKim believed that Howell\u2019s e-mail did just that. Though Howell connected utilitarian analysis to the role of individual consent, utilitarianism does not; utilitarianism takes a purely consequential approach to moral reasoning irrespective of individual consent. Further, according to McKim, Howell\u2019s account of how a utilitarian would assess a decision of whether to engage in homosexual activity misstates how a utilitarian would assess the full range of interests at stake. The Committee need not evaluate that judgment at this point save to say that the criticism cannot be said on its face to be without substance.4 Professor Howell\u2019s competence in the subject can and should be subject to collegial review; but, because of the unique history of his status, no review was ever undertaken.\n2. Distance. The question of \u201cdistance,\u201d as Professor McKim put it to the Committee, is a matter of some delicacy. Professor McKim opined that in law, philosophy, classics, and any number of other disciplines the instructor could espouse a theory and vigorously defend it in anticipation, in due course, of student rebuttal or \u201cpush back.\u201d He agreed that such espousal would be an exercise of academic freedom so long as the students were not held to account for agreement with the instructor\u2019s views. But religion, he opined, is different. It is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing upon history, philosophy, archaeology, linguistics, and more. There is no \u201ccorrect\u201d or dogmatic view, i.e., a religion may hold such, but the academic analysis of religion does not. Thus, he maintained, the department, reflecting the thought of the discipline as a whole, believed that instructors had to retain \u201cdistance\u201d on the subject.\n The instructor may say that as it is what the faith maintains to be true. A student asks, \u201cAs you are of that faith, do you believe that to be true?\u201d He answers that he does, as well he should.  May the instructor say, \u201cyes\u201d? McKim thought that he could; but, were the instructor to take the initiative consistently to convey the truth of his tradition as he saw it such would be beyond the bounds of academic freedom. Members of the Committee asked if he had any firm knowledge that that is what Professor Howell had been doing. He had none, but he understood the e-mail as stating the Catholic position on homosexuality not as a proposition of theology but as a proposition of fact about the real (or natural) world, one that should command student agreement as such, not as a religious proposition subject to scrutiny. He agreed that the idea of \u201cdistance\u201d is a gray area, one he had struggled with. Yet, he insisted, his colleagues were unanimous that such was a key feature of the discipline and that Howell\u2019s e-mail had departed from it.\nFor his part, Professor Howell maintained that he never required students to accept his position on Catholic doctrine. He insisted that his intent was to have his students think critically about the subject, not to accept his view of it.\nThe Committee comes away from its investigation on this point with two observations. First, it is not persuaded that religion differs in any significant regard from any other discipline: a disciplinary proposition maintained by an instructor in archeology may set flame afresh to disputes in India or Israel; a paleontological proposition may kindle strongly held religious objection; an historical argument might ignite any number of ethnic passions. The profession has long drawn the distinction between the essaying of one\u2019s conclusions, arrived at by the exercise of a professional standard of care, as much before one\u2019s students as before one\u2019s peers, from an insistence that one\u2019s students concur in one\u2019s conclusions on professionally controverted questions.\nSecond, and closely related, is that the distinction between advocacy and indoctrination can be a delicate matter: what is said and what is heard can sometimes be very different and may depend on the listener more than the speaker. When faculty tread near that line must they be cautious about transgressing it? Because one would tend to steer wider the zone when the line is indistinct we fear that a painstaking parsing of what is said in hindsight can conduce toward a stultifying degree of self-censorship in future. Nevertheless, where there is evidence that, with due allowance for the \u201cbreathing space\u201d academic freedom requires, the line has been crossed a department cannot be indifferent to it.\nIn this case, Professor Howell has insisted that his e-mail expounded what the church maintains moral natural law teaches to be true and he himself did not expound that this belief as \u201ctruth.\u201d The difficulty is that elements in his message can be read in support of both. Though he maintained that he was attempting to stimulate critical thought and further study, the text, as read by Professors McKim and others, is capable of a different interpretation.\nConsequently, all that can be said at this stage is that it is an exercise of academic freedom for a professor to put before her students her conclusions on professionally controverted questions, even vigorously to advance them, so long as students are not held to account for agreement with them; and that this is as much so for the study of religion as for any other discipline. Dr. Howell has pointed out that, save for this episode, no student of the many he has taught over the years has complained that he\u2019d crossed the line and that his students include increasing numbers of non-Catholics, although Catholics still comprise a large majority of the students taking his classes. Even so, from the text of this message and the reading given it by faculty and administrators, we believe that there is a real question of whether, in this instance, Professor Howell has observed the distinction he drew.\n3. Offensiveness. From the foregoing it should be clear that students have no right not to be offended; indeed, students deeply committed to some economic, political, religious, or philosophical teachings may be profoundly offended by having to engage with faculty criticism of those teachings-the more serious and thoughtful the criticism, the greater the likelihood of offense. We could not do our job, which is to instill the habits of a critical mind, if we had to be chary of giving offense. Accordingly, Professor Howell\u2019s observations on homosexuality, relevant to the subject of moral natural law and its relationship to utilitarianism, should not be held to account because a student took offense. But they can be faulted on grounds having nothing to do with hostile student reaction; that is, as the Committee reads it, for being unlearned and jejune.\nWe offer the following for future guidance based upon this episode.\n1. The university should adopt clear policies governing the appointment and renewal of adjunct faculty. Models exist elsewhere; the American Association of University Professors has proposed one.5 CAFT takes no position now on the detailed workings of what should be adopted save to stress that, at a minimum, it should require written notice of appointment, timely written notice of reappointment or non-reappointment, and make express provision for mandatory evaluation and review. Access to a grievance procedure and an assurance of due process for a dismissal during a period of service ought also be provided.\n2. Given the abrogation of the agreement between the university and the Newman Foundation, the Department of Religion is free to decide whether it wishes to continue to offer courses in Catholic thought. Should the Department decide to continue those or similar offerings, the Department is free to appoint a candidate it deems best qualified to teach them, for example, by conducting a search for a suitable candidate.6 Dr. Howell has expressed his strong desire to the Committee to continue to teach courses in Catholic thought in the University. Accordingly, the Department should consider him for appointment or, should it wish to conduct a wider search, should place him under consideration in conjunction with others.\n3. A declination to offer an appointment is not subject to challenge before the CAFT. However, due to the unique circumstances of this case, and the public controversy surrounding it, should the department decline to continue Dr. Howell in adjunct instruction and should Dr. Howell assert that that decision was based on considerations significantly violative of academic freedom the Committee believes that it ought be available to allow Dr. Howell to prove that that was so.\n\u0002 The history is recounted by Winton Solberg, The Catholic Presence at the University of Illinois, 76 CATHOLIC HIST. REV. 765 (1990).\n\u0002 This information was supplied by the office of the Chancellor accompanied by the names, and periods of services for all persons in these classifications for each semester of this academic year.\n\u0002 In a closely analogous instance such was the conclusion of Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the American Association of University Professors. Academic Freedom and Tenure: City University of New York, 90 ACADEME 43, 57 (Nov.-Dec. 2004).

As will appear in the discussion to follow, while his syllabi were approved the actual practice of his teaching was never formally evaluated; there was never formal departmental review attendant to a decision to continue-or discontinue-his appointment. It was simply assumed that he would continue from year to year, and he did. Toward the end of the Spring 2010 semester, i.e., at the time of the event in question, his course, Introduction to Catholicism 127, was listed for the Fall 2010 semester under his instruction.\nIn May, 2010, a student e-mailed a message to Professor McKim relaying and enclosing a complaint about Dr. Howell from a student in Howell\u2019s class on Introduction to Catholicism. The student attached an e-mail message from Dr. Howell to that class, sent in preparation for the final examination, which formed the basis for the student\u2019s complaint. It is appended to this report.\nProfessor McKim was deeply disturbed by Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail on three grounds: (1) that the treatment of utilitarianism was \u201cunprofessional,\u201d i.e., he considered Howell\u2019s discussion of consent to be out of place and his treatment of consequentialism to distort the idea that he was supposed to be explaining; (2) that the treatment of homosexuality in natural moral law lacked intellectual \u201cdistance,\u201d i.e., to Professor McKim it purveyed what the Church believes to be true as an incontrovertable truth presented as such and, as presented, i.e., as a matter that the students are ill-equipped independently to question, to suggest that the students accept the instructor\u2019s assertion of what the truth is; and, (3) that the treatment of homosexuality evidenced \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in that it could be expected to and did offend, as evidenced in the student\u2019s protest, especially his comments on the assumption of the sexual roles of the male and female in homosexual intercourse and the medical aspects of homosexual sex based upon a single anecdotal reference.\nProfessor McKim shared Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail with three senior colleagues who composed the department\u2019s promotion and tenure committee as well as with a fourth because of the latter\u2019s disciplinary expertise in Christianity. One found the e-mail to evidence professional incompetence to such an extent as to warrant termination. One suggested that Prof. McKim explore with Dr. Howell whether he, Howell, did not think the message unacceptable and why. A third said that the relationship with the Newman Foundation should be terminated which the Committee takes to intend a termination of Dr. Howell\u2019s relationship to the department as well. Professor McKim also discussed the e-mail with Professor Douglas Kibbee, Director of the School of Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics, who did not address the content of the message, and with Ann Mester, Associate Dean of LAS.\nProfessor McKim told the subcommittee that, as deeply disturbed as he was by Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail, he had not yet decided on a course of action but that Associate Dean Mester, as advised by campus counsel, was of the view that Howell ought not be continued. This, he understood, arose out of concern that the university might be sued by \u201cthe gay community\u201d over the tenor of Howell\u2019s remarks. More broadly, he told the committee, he was concerned about Howell\u2019s \u201con-going\u201d and \u201csystematic\u201d crossing of the \u201cboundary\u201d between teaching and indoctrination (though he acknowledged that this was mainly conversational evidence with students\u2013the department had not formally documented this). Dean Mester told the committee that she was concerned about the e-mail\u2019s content: primarily by its treatment of Catholic thought, as embodying a truth that the students were ill-equipped to question, which she regarded as a closing off of debate on what should be a debatable subject; but also by the possibility that the e-mail could create a hostile atmosphere for gay and bisexual students. She consulted Dean Watkins who advised her to consult campus counsel. In Mester\u2019s view, confirmed by campus counsel, there was no obligation to continue Dr. Howell as an adjunct; in fact, as he was not to be paid by the university he was not, in her view, even an employee of the University. She informed the committee that the appointment of another adjunct (whose name need not be mentioned) had been similarly discontinued summarily for \u201cinappropriate teaching\u201d without incident.\nDean Mester was eventually able to discuss the matter with campus counsel Stephen Veazie. According to Veazie, he did not advise termination, but he saw no problem with terminating Dr. Howell\u2019s relationship so long as no apology on the department or university\u2019s part was made which might have implied institutional acceptance of responsibility for Howell\u2019s e-mail message. Mester told the undersigned that she informed Prof. McKim that he was free to act as he saw best so long as he addressed counsel\u2019s caution. In sum, Dean Mester, as the \u201cpoint person\u201d from the administration\u2019s perspective at this time, understood that she was transmitting a \u201cconsensus view\u201d endorsing the course of action that Professor McKim was advocating. Professor McKim understood that this option, which he was leaning toward, was being strongly encouraged if not actually ordered by the administration.\nProfessor McKim met with Dr. Howell to ascertain if the content of the e-mail was accurate: if he had transmitted it and whether it was the text he had transmitted. If so, he had decided to inform Howell that his appointment would not be continued. Howell confirmed the accuracy of the text and McKim informed Howell of his decision. According to Prof. McKim, he briefly canvassed the reasons for this action: that students would, rightly, be disturbed by his treatment of homosexuality, of the examples Howell had used; that it was insensitive and embarrassing. That Howell\u2019s treatment of utilitarianism was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d (to which Howell said, \u201cyou [meaning McKim in a personal sense] would have caught this\u201d). And that his presentation of moral natural law \u201clacked distance.\u201d Initially, McKim stated, Howell did not understand that he was being terminated. Howell said they\u2019d talk more about it upon their respective return from foreign travels. So McKim had emphatically to inform Howell that he would not be returned to teaching in the Fall. Insofar as the department was concerned that is where the matter rested.\nDr. Howell remembers this conversation a little differently. He did not recall his treatment of utilitarianism to have been a subject of discussion. Prof. McKim\u2019s primary concern was for the \u201cdamage\u201d Howell\u2019s treatment of homosexuality might cause the department and the university. McKim stated that the department had an interest in not offending students to which Howell replied that his role was not to make students \u201cfeel good\u201d but to get them to think. Nevertheless, McKim asserted that on issues of special sensitivity one \u201chas to be very careful.\u201d The conversation proceeded on to the e-mail\u2019s treatment of moral natural law. Howell believed that McKim\u2019s personal pedagogical style, as is that of others in the department, is to decline to state his own conclusions. Howell\u2019s approach is different: he is candid about his beliefs, but he insisted that he does not require students to accept his position. In other words, he draws a distinction between permissible advocacy and impermissible indoctrination. The Committee pressed him on the ground that his e-mail message could be read to state that as the teachings of moral natural law on human sexuality were grounded in \u201creality\u201d and not in Church doctrine, a fair implication was that the students would be expected to agree with it-for who could contest an obvious reality of the natural world?-and, indeed, were admonished that they lacked the intellectual training to contest it. Dr. Howell stated that he was presenting the Church\u2019s view of the truth as the Church\u2019s view, not as truth in itself; and that his observation about the lack of student research grounding was meant to stimulate just such a student effort at independent research and thought. Dr. Howell was emphatic in his statements to the Committee that his role was to encourage critical thought, not to instill doctrine.\nDr. Howell confirmed that he left the meeting with Prof. McKim thinking the matter an open one. After McKim made it clear that Howell had been terminated he sought legal counsel from the Alliance Defense Fund.\nThe decision became the subject of public controversy not only surrounding Dr. Howell\u2019s termination but also in regard to the relationship of the Department of Religion to the Newman Foundation. On the former, the public controversy, letters were received by the administration from the Alliance Defense Fund on behalf of Dr. Howell and from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), which made what the Committee takes to be a thinly veiled threat of litigation. A meeting was held in mid-July involving a number of high-level administrators the result of which was a decision to offer Dr. Howell an appointment for the Fall semester. Professor McKim was informed of this decision. He did not agree with it; but, as the matter was out of his hands, he was in no position other than to state his lack of concurrence. There is no dispute that this decision was influenced by the university\u2019s concern over a possible lawsuit-the absence of any documented record of Dr. Howell\u2019s lack of professionalism in teaching would fare badly in defending that ground as a valid ground of action-and by the procedural concern that it would be better to maintain the status quo ante whilst the academic freedom issues were to be sorted out by the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure. Dr. Howell accepted appointment offered for the Fall 2010 semester.\nOn the latter, the relationship with the Newman Foundation, negotiations commenced with the Foundation and the Diocese of Peoria culminating in an agreement amicably arrived at in late July to terminate the arrangement with the Foundation. Henceforth, adjunct appointments in the Department of Religion would be made by the department through its process for appointment and renewal and the adjunct appointees paid by the university.\nIn this case issues of procedure and of substance are closely intertwined. It is necessary to separate them for analytical purposes.\nEach academic unit is thus at liberty to act as it will with respect to such appointees and, not surprisingly, practice varies widely. In the History Department adjuncts (and other non-tenure track appointees) have their teaching subject to peer evaluation, usually annually, have their ICES scores reviewed by the department chair and are counseled by the chair in consultation with the executive committee if concerns about the quality of teaching surface. The College of Law does not require in-class review of adjuncts. The appointment of adjunct faculty is vetted by the College\u2019s appointments committee subject to oversight by the faculty as a whole. Review thereafter is done by the Associate Dean, primarily on the basis of ICES scores and student comment. Underperforming adjunct faculty may be counseled in order to improve or simply not offered teaching assignments in the future. In the Department of Religion the head received the ICES reports on Dr. Howell, in recent years the department\u2019s only adjunct teacher, but no other review was undertaken and, as Dr. Howell had favorable ICES scores, his continuance was assumed as a matter of course requiring no further collegial action. As Professor McKim noted, the relationship with the Newman Center and Dr. Howell was felt as a fait accompli.\nThis regulatory vacuum abetted the difficulty the department encountered in the wake of Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail. As the foregoing summary indicates, there was a degree of uncertainty about just what his relationship to the department was at that time. The administration, as advised by legal counsel, took the position that he was either a prospective employee or, even in his current adjunct status, one who could be continued or not at the university\u2019s discretion. It is not obvious to the Committee that that was so. Dr. Howell had held the title of Adjunct Associate Professor for many years, had taught continuously without official notice of renewal, had expected to teach Introduction to Roman Catholicism, as did the department, and had been listed as teaching that offering in the Fall. By academic rather than legal standards a persuasive argument could be made that his summary removal from the course assigned in the Fall because of the content of his e-mail was a dismissal on which he should have been afforded academic due process.3 Thus the episode draws attention to a significant lacuna in the university\u2019s regulations and one that is likely to become more vexing the more this university, as do many others, comes to rely on contingent faculty to assume a larger share of teaching. We will recommend a corrective course at the close.\nInasmuch as Dr. Howell has been reinstated, the Committee\u2019s observations on his message to his students are intended for guidance in future. At the threshold, however, the standard to be applied to that communication needs be addressed.\nOn the one hand, in the give-and-take of classroom discussion and debate impromptu analogies or metaphors may be uttered or ideas essayed spontaneously that may be offensive to some but which may nevertheless serve a sound pedagogical purpose-to stimulate, instigate, or prod students to think critically about the matter at hand or to think skeptically about a disciplinary proposition. Such remarks are intensely context-specific: as they draw sustenance and immediacy from the chemistry of the class such passing remarks, when laid upon a bare page and taken in the abstract, may well be misunderstood. On the other hand, professional publications should be expected to have been well worked through; they are laid upon a bare page and are held up for critical assessment by professional standards of scholarly care.\nDr. Howell\u2019s e-mail was sent to students in Religion 127-and copied to students in a more advanced course-to dispel their confusion about how utilitarianism as an ethical system related to moral natural law. Though it does not bear all the earmarks of a finely wrought professional exercise it is more like a thought-through professional exposition than an impromptu classroom expostulation and we shall treat it as such. And as such we need to consider the three problematical aspects identified by Professor McKim and the Associate Dean of LAS.\n1. Utilitarianism. Professor McKim, in consultation with other senior faculty in the department, believed Professor Howell\u2019s explanation of utilitarianism to have been woefully deficient to the point even of questioning Howell\u2019s professional competence. Obviously, a manifest failure to comprehend the subject or to explain it accurately is not sheltered by academic freedom; and Professor McKim believed that Howell\u2019s e-mail did just that. Though Howell connected utilitarian analysis to the role of individual consent, utilitarianism does not; utilitarianism takes a purely consequential approach to moral reasoning irrespective of individual consent. Further, according to McKim, Howell\u2019s account of how a utilitarian would assess a decision of whether to engage in homosexual activity misstates how a utilitarian would assess the full range of interests at stake. The Committee need not evaluate that judgment at this point save to say that the criticism cannot be said on its face to be without substance.4 Professor Howell\u2019s competence in the subject can and should be subject to collegial review; but, because of the unique history of his status, no review was ever undertaken.\n2. Distance. The question of \u201cdistance,\u201d as Professor McKim put it to the Committee, is a matter of some delicacy. Professor McKim opined that in law, philosophy, classics, and any number of other disciplines the instructor could espouse a theory and vigorously defend it in anticipation, in due course, of student rebuttal or \u201cpush back.\u201d He agreed that such espousal would be an exercise of academic freedom so long as the students were not held to account for agreement with the instructor\u2019s views. But religion, he opined, is different. It is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing upon history, philosophy, archaeology, linguistics, and more. There is no \u201ccorrect\u201d or dogmatic view, i.e., a religion may hold such, but the academic analysis of religion does not. Thus, he maintained, the department, reflecting the thought of the discipline as a whole, believed that instructors had to retain \u201cdistance\u201d on the subject.\n The instructor may say that as it is what the faith maintains to be true. A student asks, \u201cAs you are of that faith, do you believe that to be true?\u201d He answers that he does, as well he should.  May the instructor say, \u201cyes\u201d? McKim thought that he could; but, were the instructor to take the initiative consistently to convey the truth of his tradition as he saw it such would be beyond the bounds of academic freedom. Members of the Committee asked if he had any firm knowledge that that is what Professor Howell had been doing. He had none, but he understood the e-mail as stating the Catholic position on homosexuality not as a proposition of theology but as a proposition of fact about the real (or natural) world, one that should command student agreement as such, not as a religious proposition subject to scrutiny. He agreed that the idea of \u201cdistance\u201d is a gray area, one he had struggled with. Yet, he insisted, his colleagues were unanimous that such was a key feature of the discipline and that Howell\u2019s e-mail had departed from it.\nFor his part, Professor Howell maintained that he never required students to accept his position on Catholic doctrine. He insisted that his intent was to have his students think critically about the subject, not to accept his view of it.\nThe Committee comes away from its investigation on this point with two observations. First, it is not persuaded that religion differs in any significant regard from any other discipline: a disciplinary proposition maintained by an instructor in archeology may set flame afresh to disputes in India or Israel; a paleontological proposition may kindle strongly held religious objection; an historical argument might ignite any number of ethnic passions. The profession has long drawn the distinction between the essaying of one\u2019s conclusions, arrived at by the exercise of a professional standard of care, as much before one\u2019s students as before one\u2019s peers, from an insistence that one\u2019s students concur in one\u2019s conclusions on professionally controverted questions.\nSecond, and closely related, is that the distinction between advocacy and indoctrination can be a delicate matter: what is said and what is heard can sometimes be very different and may depend on the listener more than the speaker. When faculty tread near that line must they be cautious about transgressing it? Because one would tend to steer wider the zone when the line is indistinct we fear that a painstaking parsing of what is said in hindsight can conduce toward a stultifying degree of self-censorship in future. Nevertheless, where there is evidence that, with due allowance for the \u201cbreathing space\u201d academic freedom requires, the line has been crossed a department cannot be indifferent to it.\nIn this case, Professor Howell has insisted that his e-mail expounded what the church maintains moral natural law teaches to be true and he himself did not expound that this belief as \u201ctruth.\u201d The difficulty is that elements in his message can be read in support of both. Though he maintained that he was attempting to stimulate critical thought and further study, the text, as read by Professors McKim and others, is capable of a different interpretation.\nConsequently, all that can be said at this stage is that it is an exercise of academic freedom for a professor to put before her students her conclusions on professionally controverted questions, even vigorously to advance them, so long as students are not held to account for agreement with them; and that this is as much so for the study of religion as for any other discipline. Dr. Howell has pointed out that, save for this episode, no student of the many he has taught over the years has complained that he\u2019d crossed the line and that his students include increasing numbers of non-Catholics, although Catholics still comprise a large majority of the students taking his classes. Even so, from the text of this message and the reading given it by faculty and administrators, we believe that there is a real question of whether, in this instance, Professor Howell has observed the distinction he drew.\n3. Offensiveness. From the foregoing it should be clear that students have no right not to be offended; indeed, students deeply committed to some economic, political, religious, or philosophical teachings may be profoundly offended by having to engage with faculty criticism of those teachings-the more serious and thoughtful the criticism, the greater the likelihood of offense. We could not do our job, which is to instill the habits of a critical mind, if we had to be chary of giving offense. Accordingly, Professor Howell\u2019s observations on homosexuality, relevant to the subject of moral natural law and its relationship to utilitarianism, should not be held to account because a student took offense. But they can be faulted on grounds having nothing to do with hostile student reaction; that is, as the Committee reads it, for being unlearned and jejune.\nWe offer the following for future guidance based upon this episode.\n1. The university should adopt clear policies governing the appointment and renewal of adjunct faculty. Models exist elsewhere; the American Association of University Professors has proposed one.5 CAFT takes no position now on the detailed workings of what should be adopted save to stress that, at a minimum, it should require written notice of appointment, timely written notice of reappointment or non-reappointment, and make express provision for mandatory evaluation and review. Access to a grievance procedure and an assurance of due process for a dismissal during a period of service ought also be provided.\n2. Given the abrogation of the agreement between the university and the Newman Foundation, the Department of Religion is free to decide whether it wishes to continue to offer courses in Catholic thought. Should the Department decide to continue those or similar offerings, the Department is free to appoint a candidate it deems best qualified to teach them, for example, by conducting a search for a suitable candidate.6 Dr. Howell has expressed his strong desire to the Committee to continue to teach courses in Catholic thought in the University. Accordingly, the Department should consider him for appointment or, should it wish to conduct a wider search, should place him under consideration in conjunction with others.\n3. A declination to offer an appointment is not subject to challenge before the CAFT. However, due to the unique circumstances of this case, and the public controversy surrounding it, should the department decline to continue Dr. Howell in adjunct instruction and should Dr. Howell assert that that decision was based on considerations significantly violative of academic freedom the Committee believes that it ought be available to allow Dr. Howell to prove that that was so.\n\u0002 The history is recounted by Winton Solberg, The Catholic Presence at the University of Illinois, 76 CATHOLIC HIST. REV. 765 (1990).\n\u0002 This information was supplied by the office of the Chancellor accompanied by the names, and periods of services for all persons in these classifications for each semester of this academic year.\n\u0002 In a closely analogous instance such was the conclusion of Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the American Association of University Professors. Academic Freedom and Tenure: City University of New York, 90 ACADEME 43, 57 (Nov.-Dec. 2004). The chair of CAFT served as chair of this ad hoc committee of investigation.\n\u0002 See Roger Crisp & Tim Chapell, Utilitarianism, in ROUTLEDGE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY (E. Craig ed.)

Easter charged the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure (CAFT) as follows: \u201cto determine whether the process leading to the decision followed Departmental and College policies and also if the decision to discontinue Dr. [Kenneth] Howell\u2019s adjunct appointment did indeed constitute a violation of academic freedom.\u201d Toward that end and pursuant to its rules CAFT appointed the undersigned subcommittee to inquire and report to the Committee. The subcommittee met with: Professor Robert McKim, at the time of the events under investigation the head of the Department of Religion in the School of Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS); Ann Mester, Associate Dean of LAS; Ruth Watkins, Dean of LAS; Steven Veazie, Esq., Campus Legal Counsel; and Dr. Howell (who was accompanied by his legal counsel and a monsignor of the Roman Catholic Church). All those interviewed were most cooperative and we are indebted for their candor.\nWhat follows will summarize the events under investigation the basic facts of which are not in dispute. We will then state what we see as the issues these events present and will analyze them from the perspective of university policy and sound academic practice. At the close, we will offer some recommendations for future action.\nIndividuals will be proposed for adjunct faculty status by the Newman Foundation, and shall hold appropriate scholarly credentials and shall be reviewed and approved for adjunct status according to the standard procedures for such positions. The faculty members and courses shall be subject to the same review and supervision by the Program for the Study of Religion as apply to all courses and members of the Program\u2019s faculty. In turn, the adjunct faculty affiliated with the Newman Foundation shall have the rights and privileges accorded all faculty holding the same positions.\nAccording to Professor McKim, at that point from the department\u2019s perspective the glass became \u201chalf full\u201d: the department was pleased that it and LAS had assumed oversight of course content but, despite the requirement of departmental review and approval of the adjunct instructors submitted by the Newman Foundation, for practical purposes, in the department\u2019s view, the Newman Foundation continued to retain control over the designation of instructional staff. The department understood Dr. Howell, who had taught those courses for several years without faculty review of his teaching and without formal consideration of his continuance, to be, in effect, a legacy of the prior arrangement. As will appear in the discussion to follow, while his syllabi were approved the actual practice of his teaching was never formally evaluated; there was never formal departmental review attendant to a decision to continue-or discontinue-his appointment. It was simply assumed that he would continue from year to year, and he did. Toward the end of the Spring 2010 semester, i.e., at the time of the event in question, his course, Introduction to Catholicism 127, was listed for the Fall 2010 semester under his instruction.\nIn May, 2010, a student e-mailed a message to Professor McKim relaying and enclosing a complaint about Dr. Howell from a student in Howell\u2019s class on Introduction to Catholicism. The student attached an e-mail message from Dr. Howell to that class, sent in preparation for the final examination, which formed the basis for the student\u2019s complaint. It is appended to this report.\nProfessor McKim was deeply disturbed by Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail on three grounds: (1) that the treatment of utilitarianism was \u201cunprofessional,\u201d i.e., he considered Howell\u2019s discussion of consent to be out of place and his treatment of consequentialism to distort the idea that he was supposed to be explaining; (2) that the treatment of homosexuality in natural moral law lacked intellectual \u201cdistance,\u201d i.e., to Professor McKim it purveyed what the Church believes to be true as an incontrovertable truth presented as such and, as presented, i.e., as a matter that the students are ill-equipped independently to question, to suggest that the students accept the instructor\u2019s assertion of what the truth is; and, (3) that the treatment of homosexuality evidenced \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in that it could be expected to and did offend, as evidenced in the student\u2019s protest, especially his comments on the assumption of the sexual roles of the male and female in homosexual intercourse and the medical aspects of homosexual sex based upon a single anecdotal reference.\nProfessor McKim shared Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail with three senior colleagues who composed the department\u2019s promotion and tenure committee as well as with a fourth because of the latter\u2019s disciplinary expertise in Christianity. One found the e-mail to evidence professional incompetence to such an extent as to warrant termination. One suggested that Prof. McKim explore with Dr. Howell whether he, Howell, did not think the message unacceptable and why. A third said that the relationship with the Newman Foundation should be terminated which the Committee takes to intend a termination of Dr. Howell\u2019s relationship to the department as well. Professor McKim also discussed the e-mail with Professor Douglas Kibbee, Director of the School of Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics, who did not address the content of the message, and with Ann Mester, Associate Dean of LAS.\nProfessor McKim told the subcommittee that, as deeply disturbed as he was by Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail, he had not yet decided on a course of action but that Associate Dean Mester, as advised by campus counsel, was of the view that Howell ought not be continued. This, he understood, arose out of concern that the university might be sued by \u201cthe gay community\u201d over the tenor of Howell\u2019s remarks.

She consulted Dean Watkins who advised her to consult campus counsel. In Mester\u2019s view, confirmed by campus counsel, there was no obligation to continue Dr. Howell as an adjunct; in fact, as he was not to be paid by the university he was not, in her view, even an employee of the University. She informed the committee that the appointment of another adjunct (whose name need not be mentioned) had been similarly discontinued summarily for \u201cinappropriate teaching\u201d without incident.\nDean Mester was eventually able to discuss the matter with campus counsel Stephen Veazie. According to Veazie, he did not advise termination, but he saw no problem with terminating Dr. Howell\u2019s relationship so long as no apology on the department or university\u2019s part was made which might have implied institutional acceptance of responsibility for Howell\u2019s e-mail message. Mester told the undersigned that she informed Prof. McKim that he was free to act as he saw best so long as he addressed counsel\u2019s caution. In sum, Dean Mester, as the \u201cpoint person\u201d from the administration\u2019s perspective at this time, understood that she was transmitting a \u201cconsensus view\u201d endorsing the course of action that Professor McKim was advocating. Professor McKim understood that this option, which he was leaning toward, was being strongly encouraged if not actually ordered by the administration.\nProfessor McKim met with Dr. Howell to ascertain if the content of the e-mail was accurate: if he had transmitted it and whether it was the text he had transmitted.

Howell said they\u2019d talk more about it upon their respective return from foreign travels. So McKim had emphatically to inform Howell that he would not be returned to teaching in the Fall. Insofar as the department was concerned that is where the matter rested.\nDr. Howell remembers this conversation a little differently. He did not recall his treatment of utilitarianism to have been a subject of discussion. Prof. McKim\u2019s primary concern was for the \u201cdamage\u201d Howell\u2019s treatment of homosexuality might cause the department and the university. McKim stated that the department had an interest in not offending students to which Howell replied that his role was not to make students \u201cfeel good\u201d but to get them to think. Nevertheless, McKim asserted that on issues of special sensitivity one \u201chas to be very careful.\u201d The conversation proceeded on to the e-mail\u2019s treatment of moral natural law. Howell believed that McKim\u2019s personal pedagogical style, as is that of others in the department, is to decline to state his own conclusions. Howell\u2019s approach is different: he is candid about his beliefs, but he insisted that he does not require students to accept his position. In other words, he draws a distinction between permissible advocacy and impermissible indoctrination. The Committee pressed him on the ground that his e-mail message could be read to state that as the teachings of moral natural law on human sexuality were grounded in \u201creality\u201d and not in Church doctrine, a fair implication was that the students would be expected to agree with it-for who could contest an obvious reality of the natural world?-and, indeed, were admonished that they lacked the intellectual training to contest it. Dr. Howell stated that he was presenting the Church\u2019s view of the truth as the Church\u2019s view, not as truth in itself; and that his observation about the lack of student research grounding was meant to stimulate just such a student effort at independent research and thought. Dr. Howell was emphatic in his statements to the Committee that his role was to encourage critical thought, not to instill doctrine.\nDr. Howell confirmed that he left the meeting with Prof. McKim thinking the matter an open one. After McKim made it clear that Howell had been terminated he sought legal counsel from the Alliance Defense Fund.\nThe decision became the subject of public controversy not only surrounding Dr. Howell\u2019s termination but also in regard to the relationship of the Department of Religion to the Newman Foundation. On the former, the public controversy, letters were received by the administration from the Alliance Defense Fund on behalf of Dr. Howell and from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), which made what the Committee takes to be a thinly veiled threat of litigation. A meeting was held in mid-July involving a number of high-level administrators the result of which was a decision to offer Dr. Howell an appointment for the Fall semester. Professor McKim was informed of this decision. He did not agree with it; but, as the matter was out of his hands, he was in no position other than to state his lack of concurrence. There is no dispute that this decision was influenced by the university\u2019s concern over a possible lawsuit-the absence of any documented record of Dr. Howell\u2019s lack of professionalism in teaching would fare badly in defending that ground as a valid ground of action-and by the procedural concern that it would be better to maintain the status quo ante whilst the academic freedom issues were to be sorted out by the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure. Dr. Howell accepted appointment offered for the Fall 2010 semester.\nOn the latter, the relationship with the Newman Foundation, negotiations commenced with the Foundation and the Diocese of Peoria culminating in an agreement amicably arrived at in late July to terminate the arrangement with the Foundation. Henceforth, adjunct appointments in the Department of Religion would be made by the department through its process for appointment and renewal and the adjunct appointees paid by the university.\nIn this case issues of procedure and of substance are closely intertwined. It is necessary to separate them for analytical purposes.\nEach academic unit is thus at liberty to act as it will with respect to such appointees and, not surprisingly, practice varies widely. In the History Department adjuncts (and other non-tenure track appointees) have their teaching subject to peer evaluation, usually annually, have their ICES scores reviewed by the department chair and are counseled by the chair in consultation with the executive committee if concerns about the quality of teaching surface. The College of Law does not require in-class review of adjuncts. The appointment of adjunct faculty is vetted by the College\u2019s appointments committee subject to oversight by the faculty as a whole. Review thereafter is done by the Associate Dean, primarily on the basis of ICES scores and student comment. Underperforming adjunct faculty may be counseled in order to improve or simply not offered teaching assignments in the future. In the Department of Religion the head received the ICES reports on Dr. Howell, in recent years the department\u2019s only adjunct teacher, but no other review was undertaken and, as Dr. Howell had favorable ICES scores, his continuance was assumed as a matter of course requiring no further collegial action. As Professor McKim noted, the relationship with the Newman Center and Dr. Howell was felt as a fait accompli.\nThis regulatory vacuum abetted the difficulty the department encountered in the wake of Dr. Howell\u2019s e-mail. As the foregoing summary indicates, there was a degree of uncertainty about just what his relationship to the department was at that time. The administration, as advised by legal counsel, took the position that he was either a prospective employee or, even in his current adjunct status, one who could be continued or not at the university\u2019s discretion. It is not obvious to the Committee that that was so. Dr. Howell had held the title of Adjunct Associate Professor for many years, had taught continuously without official notice of renewal, had expected to teach Introduction to Roman Catholicism, as did the department, and had been listed as teaching that offering in the Fall. By academic rather than legal standards a persuasive argument could be made that his summary removal from the course assigned in the Fall because of the content of his e-mail was a dismissal on which he should have been afforded academic due process.3 Thus the episode draws attention to a significant lacuna in the university\u2019s regulations and one that is likely to become more vexing the more this university, as do many others, comes to rely on contingent faculty to assume a larger share of teaching. We will recommend a corrective course at the close.\nInasmuch as Dr. Howell has been reinstated, the Committee\u2019s observations on his message to his students are intended for guidance in future. At the threshold, however, the standard to be applied to that communication needs be addressed.\nOn the one hand, in the give-and-take of classroom discussion and debate impromptu analogies or metaphors may be uttered or ideas essayed spontaneously that may be offensive to some but which may nevertheless serve a sound pedagogical purpose-to stimulate, instigate, or prod students to think critically about the matter at hand or to think skeptically about a disciplinary proposition. Such remarks are intensely context-specific: as they draw sustenance and immediacy from the chemistry of the class such passing remarks, when laid upon a bare page and taken in the abstract, may well be misunderstood. On the other hand, professional publications should be expected to have been well worked through; they are laid upon a bare page and are held up for critical assessment by professional standards of scholarly care.\nDr. Howell\u2019s e-mail was sent to students in Religion 127-and copied to students in a more advanced course-to dispel their confusion about how utilitarianism as an ethical system related to moral natural law. Though it does not bear all the earmarks of a finely wrought professional exercise it is more like a thought-through professional exposition than an impromptu classroom expostulation and we shall treat it as such. And as such we need to consider the three problematical aspects identified by Professor McKim and the Associate Dean of LAS.\n1. Utilitarianism. Professor McKim, in consultation with other senior faculty in the department, believed Professor Howell\u2019s explanation of utilitarianism to have been woefully deficient to the point even of questioning Howell\u2019s professional competence. Obviously, a manifest failure to comprehend the subject or to explain it accurately is not sheltered by academic freedom; and Professor McKim believed that Howell\u2019s e-mail did just that. Though Howell connected utilitarian analysis to the role of individual consent, utilitarianism does not; utilitarianism takes a purely consequential approach to moral reasoning irrespective of individual consent. Further, according to McKim, Howell\u2019s account of how a utilitarian would assess a decision of whether to engage in homosexual activity misstates how a utilitarian would assess the full range of interests at stake. The Committee need not evaluate that judgment at this point save to say that the criticism cannot be said on its face to be without substance.4 Professor Howell\u2019s competence in the subject can and should be subject to collegial review; but, because of the unique history of his status, no review was ever undertaken.\n2. Distance. The question of \u201cdistance,\u201d as Professor McKim put it to the Committee, is a matter of some delicacy. Professor McKim opined that in law, philosophy, classics, and any number of other disciplines the instructor could espouse a theory and vigorously defend it in anticipation, in due course, of student rebuttal or \u201cpush back.\u201d He agreed that such espousal would be an exercise of academic freedom so long as the students were not held to account for agreement with the instructor\u2019s views. But religion, he opined, is different. It is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing upon history, philosophy, archaeology, linguistics, and more. There is no \u201ccorrect\u201d or dogmatic view, i.e., a religion may hold such, but the academic analysis of religion does not. Thus, he maintained, the department, reflecting the thought of the discipline as a whole, believed that instructors had to retain \u201cdistance\u201d on the subject.\n The instructor may say that as it is what the faith maintains to be true. A student asks, \u201cAs you are of that faith, do you believe that to be true?\u201d He answers that he does, as well he should.  May the instructor say, \u201cyes\u201d? McKim thought that he could; but, were the instructor to take the initiative consistently to convey the truth of his tradition as he saw it such would be beyond the bounds of academic freedom. Members of the Committee asked if he had any firm knowledge that that is what Professor Howell had been doing. He had none, but he understood the e-mail as stating the Catholic position on homosexuality not as a proposition of theology but as a proposition of fact about the real (or natural) world, one that should command student agreement as such, not as a religious proposition subject to scrutiny. He agreed that the idea of \u201cdistance\u201d is a gray area, one he had struggled with. Yet, he insisted, his colleagues were unanimous that such was a key feature of the discipline and that Howell\u2019s e-mail had departed from it.\nFor his part, Professor Howell maintained that he never required students to accept his position on Catholic doctrine. He insisted that his intent was to have his students think critically about the subject, not to accept his view of it.\nThe Committee comes away from its investigation on this point with two observations. First, it is not persuaded that religion differs in any significant regard from any other discipline: a disciplinary proposition maintained by an instructor in archeology may set flame afresh to disputes in India or Israel; a paleontological proposition may kindle strongly held religious objection; an historical argument might ignite any number of ethnic passions. The profession has long drawn the distinction between the essaying of one\u2019s conclusions, arrived at by the exercise of a professional standard of care, as much before one\u2019s students as before one\u2019s peers, from an insistence that one\u2019s students concur in one\u2019s conclusions on professionally controverted questions.\nSecond, and closely related, is that the distinction between advocacy and indoctrination can be a delicate matter: what is said and what is heard can sometimes be very different and may depend on the listener more than the speaker. When faculty tread near that line must they be cautious about transgressing it? Because one would tend to steer wider the zone when the line is indistinct we fear that a painstaking parsing of what is said in hindsight can conduce toward a stultifying degree of self-censorship in future. Nevertheless, where there is evidence that, with due allowance for the \u201cbreathing space\u201d academic freedom requires, the line has been crossed a department cannot be indifferent to it.\nIn this case, Professor Howell has insisted that his e-mail expounded what the church maintains moral natural law teaches to be true and he himself did not expound that this belief as \u201ctruth.\u201d The difficulty is that elements in his message can be read in support of both. Though he maintained that he was attempting to stimulate critical thought and further study, the text, as read by Professors McKim and others, is capable of a different interpretation.\nConsequently, all that can be said at this stage is that it is an exercise of academic freedom for a professor to put before her students her conclusions on professionally controverted questions, even vigorously to advance them, so long as students are not held to account for agreement with them; and that this is as much so for the study of religion as for any other discipline. Dr. Howell has pointed out that, save for this episode, no student of the many he has taught over the years has complained that he\u2019d crossed the line and that his students include increasing numbers of non-Catholics, although Catholics still comprise a large majority of the students taking his classes. Even so, from the text of this message and the reading given it by faculty and administrators, we believe that there is a real question of whether, in this instance, Professor Howell has observed the distinction he drew.\n3. Offensiveness. From the foregoing it should be clear that students have no right not to be offended; indeed, students deeply committed to some economic, political, religious, or philosophical teachings may be profoundly offended by having to engage with faculty criticism of those teachings-the more serious and thoughtful the criticism, the greater the likelihood of offense. We could not do our job, which is to instill the habits of a critical mind, if we had to be chary of giving offense. Accordingly, Professor Howell\u2019s observations on homosexuality, relevant to the subject of moral natural law and its relationship to utilitarianism, should not be held to account because a student took offense. But they can be faulted on grounds having nothing to do with hostile student reaction; that is, as the Committee reads it, for being unlearned and jejune.\nWe offer the following for future guidance based upon this episode.\n1. The university should adopt clear policies governing the appointment and renewal of adjunct faculty. Models exist elsewhere; the American Association of University Professors has proposed one.5 CAFT takes no position now on the detailed workings of what should be adopted save to stress that, at a minimum, it should require written notice of appointment, timely written notice of reappointment or non-reappointment, and make express provision for mandatory evaluation and review. Access to a grievance procedure and an assurance of due process for a dismissal during a period of service ought also be provided.\n2. Given the abrogation of the agreement between the university and the Newman Foundation, the Department of Religion is free to decide whether it wishes to continue to offer courses in Catholic thought. Should the Department decide to continue those or similar offerings, the Department is free to appoint a candidate it deems best qualified to teach them, for example, by conducting a search for a suitable candidate.6 Dr. Howell has expressed his strong desire to the Committee to continue to teach courses in Catholic thought in the University. Accordingly, the Department should consider him for appointment or, should it wish to conduct a wider search, should place him under consideration in conjunction with others.\n3. A declination to offer an appointment is not subject to challenge before the CAFT. However, due to the unique circumstances of this case, and the public controversy surrounding it, should the department decline to continue Dr. Howell in adjunct instruction and should Dr. Howell assert that that decision was based on considerations significantly violative of academic freedom the Committee believes that it ought be available to allow Dr. Howell to prove that that was so.\n\u0002 The history is recounted by Winton Solberg, The Catholic Presence at the University of Illinois, 76 CATHOLIC HIST. REV. 765 (1990).\n\u0002 This information was supplied by the office of the Chancellor accompanied by the names, and periods of services for all persons in these classifications for each semester of this academic year.\n\u0002 In a closely analogous instance such was the conclusion of Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the American Association of University Professors.

An OBDI vehicle would have one and an OBDII vehicle would have two. You could have a loose or faulty wiring harness connector at the converter or you may have a bad O2 sensor. Check for any wiring problems and repair as necessary. If this doesn't correct the problem, you should have a scan tool monitor the converter's oxygen sensor to see if the sensor's output is correct. You may need to have the wiring or oxygen sensor replaced. Also check the wiring and connector for your vehicle's air flow sensor.

One possibility is that the air flow sensor is dirty or not working properly and is out of range. Check the wire connections to the sensor and make sure the sensor wiring has continuity. With the ignition turned off, the air flow sensor should read 5 volts when the ground strap is pulled off. The sensor's resistance will be fairly high. It is likely that the computer is controlling the fuel system because of the air flow sensor's input. A bad MAP sensor or a leaky coolant temperature sensor can also affect the fuel system. Make sure that the wiring and connectors are free of corrosion, breaks or cuts. Check the continuity and resistance of the sensors that are connected to the computer.

One difficulty was money. When whole industries, which are involved in air pollution, are forced to reduce their negative activity, then they have to spend money on this, invest capital, and something like this then makes them less competitive on world markets, and just this disadvantage one does want to accept. And so unity is a problem. And this is just an example. But according to Bertha Dudde's prophecy everyone will be hostile towards God. And the wording intimates that also all rulers will belong to them. All of them seem to then switch to the same course. They all shall unite against God. And it will also probably be easy for them as the whole public sentiment will be against God. And anyway it will be a subject that one well can support as it hardly will cost money, and money and material things will more and more play the most important role. And in addition it will be popular with politicians, also with such who rule in democracies, as all think that way, und one can hardly lose votes, on the contrary, it will bring votes. The votes of the true Christians will be irrelevant; they are a minority which hardly counts.\nThe coming in the clouds will be the absolute climax of the end times, because it is the second coming of the Lord. Four events will take place in a very short time, probably in one day, or in a few days. The first one is that the persecution of the real believers reaches its climax. The second is the coming of the Lord in the clouds, which is dealt with in the following prophecy. The third is then the rapture. And the fourth the destruction of the surface of the earth, to which everything falls a victim what was not raptured - the judging of the living and the dead - the spiritual dead.\nIt is the day of the Lord.\nWhen now all rulers will be hostile towards God, how will then those rulers act who rule Christian countries or countries which are quite religious, may be not exactly Christian, but who also believe in a God and are spiritual orientated? The determining element will then probably be the religious leadership and as religion and to be really spiritual in reality are opposites, there will there be hardly any difficulties, because religion is largely a worldly thing and something, which always hinders true spiritual striving. People who are really spiritually orientated will always be gladly seen in such organisations, but this also only as long as such people do not start to denounce abuses. Then friendship does not extend that far and Inquisition starts.\nIt will now be interesting to watch how the rulers will act, which are already now in power and will then also still be in power or which are still to come into power and will then also be still in office until the end. In which direction will they develop? How will the heads of countries act, which have a predominantly Christian population? Especially interesting it will be to observe the conduct of politicians who are not just ruling in Christian countries, but who are also leaders of political parties who are in name Christian parties.\nBefore I had read this here stated prophecy by Bertha Dudde, I had thought about how differently the individual world leaders, and with them their countries, would well act in the times of the end and what differences there well would be in the persecution of the believers. But according to this prophecy the picture will probably be the same everywhere. One detail gives us an insight there: they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. That is Revelation 11:9-10. The death of the two witnesses will be celebrated like a holiday and one will send each other gifts. It says, \"they that dwell upon the earth,\" and that sounds like the general public, therefore pretty good everyone.\nIn the next verses, Revelation 11:11-12, we hear what then follows: \"And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.\"\nHere we have a description of a rapture before the rapture. The word cloud appears, exactly as at Jesus' ascension, and the word cloud also appears in the prophecy still following.\nThe rapture is an unique event, but people already got raptured earlier, these two witnesses are an example. A further example is the ascension of Jesus. Other examples from the Bible are Enoch, Genesis 5:24, \"Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him,\" and Elijah, 2 Kings 2:11, \"it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\"\nThat does not mean that raptures are just limited to these examples. There will well be many other examples where men so expedite their spiritualization, that they spiritualize their body in such a way that they no longer can be kept on this earth, that they could get raptured when they wanted to. May be they still spend a certain time here on earth, but then comes a time where they have enough, and they say goodbye, some perhaps without much publicity and others again so that \"their enemies beheld them.\"\nPhilip, the evangelist, is another case, Acts 8:39-40; he was also raptured, but from the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert, to a place on this earth, to Azotus, because the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.\nMay it be said to all of you that I will come again in the clouds - that I will come down to earth just as I once ascended to heaven - that mine will see me in brilliance and glory as once my disciples saw me, and that I will also fetch away from earth the ones who are mine, because the day of the end has come. I well am already descending in the word to earth before because I am the word myself, and I have given you the promise that I remain with you until the world's end. But my obvious coming still awaits you because it forms the conclusion of an earth period and the beginning of a new one. My coming in the clouds is to be taken literally, but only few will see me, because my flock is small, and only the ones who are mine will be able to endure my sight, I will only be visible to mine and let them see my power and glory. And that is to be your hope in hours of trouble and distress on the part of powers hostile towards God - because in the end everything will be hostile towards God, the rulers and their following, the people who side with them in the faith struggle. They all will take action against you, you who remain loyal to me and stand firm until the end. And they will harass you severely, and then you are to set your hope on my coming because I do not drop you in the trouble of the body and the soul, I will rescue you and fetch you away to a location of peace, and your faith will be strong, so that I can show myself to you when I will come in the clouds to judge the living and the dead. The the great separation of spirits takes place, and my adversary will no longer have power over you. Because he and his following will be bound for a long time. Only few people believe this earnestly that my coming again is near. But the time is fulfilled, and I no longer say: I come, when the time is fulfilled, but: The time is fulfilled - you only still can reckon on a very short time, on just few days, compared with the long time, which has passed since an end has been prophesied. You are living in the last times, even if you refuse to accept it. My coming awaits you shortly. Therefore take care that also you belong to the chosen, which will experience my coming in the flesh, who are allowed to see me in power and glory, whom I will rapture shortly before the end. Only want to belong to those, and I certainly will get you the power to also be able to let the deed follow the will. Again and again let me speak to you, and only strive for entering into my will, and you will establish the union with me, you will join me and will now also be counted with the ones who are mine, whom I will rescue before the end comes. Because that I come myself, is certain. And that all of you will be able to see me, you who livingly believe in me and bring your love towards me, that you are also to believe without doubt, because my word is truth, and it comes true. Men who deny my coming, who only want to see and explain this coming figuratively, are not yet so deep in their faith, that they are joined to me, but the great earthly trouble before the end will still strengthen their faith when they are of good will. And they themselves will implore my coming because they only see a rescue coming from myself, which no longer can come from another side. I will rescue you from deepest misery, and that you are to believe and await the hour where my promise comes true. And then my adversary will be beaten, but with him also his great following, which the earth will receive again. Therefore hope and hold out, you, who want to belong to me, because the hour of liberation comes for you, the day of the separation of spirit comes. An earthly and spiritual turning point comes, which you will experience and which was announced to you all the time in word and script. Amen. Amen. B.D.

The second is the coming of the Lord in the clouds, which is dealt with in the following prophecy. The third is then the rapture. And the fourth the destruction of the surface of the earth, to which everything falls a victim what was not raptured - the judging of the living and the dead - the spiritual dead.\nIt is the day of the Lord.\nWhen now all rulers will be hostile towards God, how will then those rulers act who rule Christian countries or countries which are quite religious, may be not exactly Christian, but who also believe in a God and are spiritual orientated? The determining element will then probably be the religious leadership and as religion and to be really spiritual in reality are opposites, there will there be hardly any difficulties, because religion is largely a worldly thing and something, which always hinders true spiritual striving. People who are really spiritually orientated will always be gladly seen in such organisations, but this also only as long as such people do not start to denounce abuses. Then friendship does not extend that far and Inquisition starts.\nIt will now be interesting to watch how the rulers will act, which are already now in power and will then also still be in power or which are still to come into power and will then also be still in office until the end. In which direction will they develop? How will the heads of countries act, which have a predominantly Christian population? Especially interesting it will be to observe the conduct of politicians who are not just ruling in Christian countries, but who are also leaders of political parties who are in name Christian parties.\nBefore I had read this here stated prophecy by Bertha Dudde, I had thought about how differently the individual world leaders, and with them their countries, would well act in the times of the end and what differences there well would be in the persecution of the believers. But according to this prophecy the picture will probably be the same everywhere. One detail gives us an insight there: they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. That is Revelation 11:9-10. The death of the two witnesses will be celebrated like a holiday and one will send each other gifts. It says, \"they that dwell upon the earth,\" and that sounds like the general public, therefore pretty good everyone.\nIn the next verses, Revelation 11:11-12, we hear what then follows: \"And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.\"\nHere we have a description of a rapture before the rapture. The word cloud appears, exactly as at Jesus' ascension, and the word cloud also appears in the prophecy still following.\nThe rapture is an unique event, but people already got raptured earlier, these two witnesses are an example. A further example is the ascension of Jesus. Other examples from the Bible are Enoch, Genesis 5:24, \"Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him,\" and Elijah, 2 Kings 2:11, \"it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\"\nThat does not mean that raptures are just limited to these examples. There will well be many other examples where men so expedite their spiritualization, that they spiritualize their body in such a way that they no longer can be kept on this earth, that they could get raptured when they wanted to. May be they still spend a certain time here on earth, but then comes a time where they have enough, and they say goodbye, some perhaps without much publicity and others again so that \"their enemies beheld them.\"\nPhilip, the evangelist, is another case, Acts 8:39-40; he was also raptured, but from the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert, to a place on this earth, to Azotus, because the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.\nMay it be said to all of you that I will come again in the clouds - that I will come down to earth just as I once ascended to heaven - that mine will see me in brilliance and glory as once my disciples saw me, and that I will also fetch away from earth the ones who are mine, because the day of the end has come. I well am already descending in the word to earth before because I am the word myself, and I have given you the promise that I remain with you until the world's end. But my obvious coming still awaits you because it forms the conclusion of an earth period and the beginning of a new one. My coming in the clouds is to be taken literally, but only few will see me, because my flock is small, and only the ones who are mine will be able to endure my sight, I will only be visible to mine and let them see my power and glory. And that is to be your hope in hours of trouble and distress on the part of powers hostile towards God - because in the end everything will be hostile towards God, the rulers and their following, the people who side with them in the faith struggle. They all will take action against you, you who remain loyal to me and stand firm until the end. And they will harass you severely, and then you are to set your hope on my coming because I do not drop you in the trouble of the body and the soul, I will rescue you and fetch you away to a location of peace, and your faith will be strong, so that I can show myself to you when I will come in the clouds to judge the living and the dead. The the great separation of spirits takes place, and my adversary will no longer have power over you. Because he and his following will be bound for a long time. Only few people believe this earnestly that my coming again is near. But the time is fulfilled, and I no longer say: I come, when the time is fulfilled, but: The time is fulfilled - you only still can reckon on a very short time, on just few days, compared with the long time, which has passed since an end has been prophesied. You are living in the last times, even if you refuse to accept it. My coming awaits you shortly. Therefore take care that also you belong to the chosen, which will experience my coming in the flesh, who are allowed to see me in power and glory, whom I will rapture shortly before the end. Only want to belong to those, and I certainly will get you the power to also be able to let the deed follow the will. Again and again let me speak to you, and only strive for entering into my will, and you will establish the union with me, you will join me and will now also be counted with the ones who are mine, whom I will rescue before the end comes. Because that I come myself, is certain. And that all of you will be able to see me, you who livingly believe in me and bring your love towards me, that you are also to believe without doubt, because my word is truth, and it comes true. Men who deny my coming, who only want to see and explain this coming figuratively, are not yet so deep in their faith, that they are joined to me, but the great earthly trouble before the end will still strengthen their faith when they are of good will. And they themselves will implore my coming because they only see a rescue coming from myself, which no longer can come from another side. I will rescue you from deepest misery, and that you are to believe and await the hour where my promise comes true. And then my adversary will be beaten, but with him also his great following, which the earth will receive again. Therefore hope and hold out, you, who want to belong to me, because the hour of liberation comes for you, the day of the separation of spirit comes. An earthly and spiritual turning point comes, which you will experience and which was announced to you all the time in word and script. Amen. Amen. B.D.

One difficulty was money. When whole industries, which are involved in air pollution, are forced to reduce their negative activity, then they have to spend money on this, invest capital, and something like this then makes them less competitive on world markets, and just this disadvantage one does want to accept. And so unity is a problem. And this is just an example. But according to Bertha Dudde's prophecy everyone will be hostile towards God. And the wording intimates that also all rulers will belong to them. All of them seem to then switch to the same course. They all shall unite against God. And it will also probably be easy for them as the whole public sentiment will be against God. And anyway it will be a subject that one well can support as it hardly will cost money, and money and material things will more and more play the most important role. And in addition it will be popular with politicians, also with such who rule in democracies, as all think that way, und one can hardly lose votes, on the contrary, it will bring votes. The votes of the true Christians will be irrelevant; they are a minority which hardly counts.\nThe coming in the clouds will be the absolute climax of the end times, because it is the second coming of the Lord.

In a league that lacks superstars, Edwards is exactly what Minnesota and NBA fans crave. And what does that mean? It means that the expectations for the Timberwolves team have dramatically increased.\n\nNo matter what team a superstar joins, they change the expectations that exist. They bring more attention and more attention leads to a greater impact. We\u2019re talking about LeBron James and Kevin Durant level of superstar here.\n\nAnt is the latest young stud to come into the league, and while not yet in his prime, is already one of the best young players in the league. And that means the 2021-22 Minnesota Timberwolves are going to be a different team. It means that the goal of a playoff run has not only become plausible, but necessary.\n\nThe days of expecting 40-loss seasons in Minnesota are now long gone.

In a league that lacks superstars, Edwards is exactly what Minnesota and NBA fans crave. And what does that mean? It means that the expectations for the Timberwolves team have dramatically increased.\n\nNo matter what team a superstar joins, they change the expectations that exist. They bring more attention and more attention leads to a greater impact. We\u2019re talking about LeBron James and Kevin Durant level of superstar here.\n\nAnt is the latest young stud to come into the league, and while not yet in his prime, is already one of the best young players in the league. And that means the 2021-22 Minnesota Timberwolves are going to be a different team. It means that the goal of a playoff run has not only become plausible, but necessary.\n\nThe days of expecting 40-loss seasons in Minnesota are now long gone.

If you suffer from anorexia, you see yourself as being fat when you are not. This condition is both a physical and a mental illness. Your body functions change as a result of low levels of body fat. In young women menstruation stops. This illness occurs most often in young women. However, about 5% to 10% of people with anorexia nervosa are men. Anorexia nervosa is a very severe illness. Death may occur from starvation or suicide. How does it occur? The cause of anorexia nervosa is not clear. In many cultures, including ours, being thin is considered beautiful and this could be one of the causes of anorexia. You may be at risk of developing anorexia nervosa if you: \u2022 have a family history of anorexia nervosa or other eating disorders \u2022 have a family or personal history of disorders, such as depression, anxiety , or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\n2. 134 What are the symptoms? Symptoms may include: \u2022 Loosing lots of weight \u2022 Binge eating (eating a lot in a short period of time) and/or purging (using laxatives or making yourself vomit) \u2022 Feeling dizzy and weak \u2022 Feeling depressed or anxious \u2022 Insomnia \u2022 If you are a woman, not menstruating \u2022 Eating very little or almost nothing \u2022 Seeing yourself as being fat when you are not \u2022 Too much exercise \u2022 Thinking about food all the time. How is it diagnosed? Your doctor will do a physical examination and will also ask your medical history. Your doctor will ask about your eating and other behaviour habits, such as: \u2022 Always choosing low calories food \u2022 Binge eating \u2022 Taking laxatives and vomiting \u2022 Strange eating habits \u2022 Over-exercising \u2022 Saying you are not hungry and that you have no problem at all with food.\n3. 135 What can be done to prevent acne? \u2022 Wash your skin twice a day and after exercise. Use a soft soap. \u2022 Shampoo your hair daily. \u2022 Don\u2019t touch the spots.It causes bleeding into the skin , infection and more spots. How is it treated? This can be a very difficult condition to treat. Your doctor will help you to start eating again. You will also probably need individual psychotherapy and family therapy. Your doctor may prescribe some medicine to: \u2022 help reduce your fear of becoming fat \u2022 help reduce depression and anxiety \u2022 help you gain weight. You may need to be hospitalised if your condition is severe and dangerous four your life. What can be done to prevent anorexia nervosa and maintain good physical health? Accepting yourself and your body can help prevent this problem. In addition you can: \u2022 See your doctor. \u2022 Eat all your meals. \u2022 Don\u2019t use laxatives. \u2022 Don\u2019t over exercise. \u2022 Don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2022 Don\u2019t smoke. Acne What is acne? Acne occurs when the oil glands in your skin become blocked. More than 90% of teenagers have acne. Acne you causes 3 types of spots: blackheads, whiteheads (pimples), and red bumps on your face, neck, and shoulders. Symptoms: \u2022 Blackheads:A blackhead results when dead skin cells and sebum block a hair follicle near the skin. \u2022 Whiteheads (pimples): These are tiny, white spots and are caused by the accumulation of sebum or oil in the pores of the skin. \u2022 Red bumps: These are the result of the infection which has spread beyond the oil gland.\n4. 136 How is it treated? \u2022 Benzoyl peroxide 5% lotion or gel: This lotion helps to open pimples and clean blackheads. It also kills bacteria. Apply the lotion once a day at bedtime. \u2022 Pimple opening the safe way: Never open a pimple before it has a yellow centre. Wash your face and hands first. Use a needle that has been sterilised. Open the surface of the yellow pimple with the tip of the needle. The pus should run out. Clean away the pus and wash the area with soap and water. Don't \"pop\" pimples by squeezing. \u2022 Large red bumps mean the infection has spread beyond the oil gland. If you have several red bumps, you probably also need an antibiotic.

She is the New Testament Gomer, and that\u2019s why Jesus revealed His identity to her, and this is the one the Father seeks to worship Him, and to receive Jesus as Husband.\n(J) I mean she gave\u2026 He gave her the, the New Testament worship. I mean He, He\u2026 Everything pivoted on what He said to her.\n(M) And the most amazing thing is that the spring of water would be within her. Not outside, not up in heaven, not a relationship, but in the true union of Husband and wife, the true internal oneness where the source would be Him within. And the spring, as we saw when I was so sick, the spring was bubbling in spite of me. I had nothing to do with the bubbling of the spring. It was flowing because He places Himself within us as the Church, and as His Bride, and as the Believer. And I think in terms of childlikeness, that\u2019s the level ground for male and female.  And that\u2019s why it says, \u201cthere\u2019s neither Greek nor Jew, nor male nor female.\u201d In the Church those distinctions are obliterated because we are all children; that helps me understand. If a man is willing to come down to that level of weakness and receptivity, to live by being sustained outside of yourself, if a man can come there, he has come to being a child. If a woman will stop looking to a man, and come down to need, her need is for God, that no man can possibly meet, then we are all, we are all on the same ground as children. So we, I think C.S. Lewis is the one that said we are so feminine in comparison to God that we are all as female. We are so receptor\u2019s that we are all female. But I like\u2026 I think I can see it easier as being a child who must receive all and owns nothing. So when we are all children together, as very much we are in this Body, then we are all on equal ground of need. But our need is not just for a Father; it\u2019s for a Husband.\n(J) Hmm, hmm.\n(M) And really I think it\u2019s pretty accepted fact that Mary the Mother of Jesus was pretty much as child when the Holy Spirit came to her, fourteen probably. So Christ comes in to the child, and the child enters the Kingdom, and the Kingdom is\u2026 The King is a Husband, and God is the great Father. So it\u2019s, it\u2019s\u2026 the issue of Husband that Fabiola brought to us is exploding for me. And it\u2019s like the Holy Spirit comes to bring everything we need in relationship, that we cannot find in any other relationship remotely. It\u2019s like I told my \u2018divorcee\u2019, (Martha laughs) you can make your children your husband. If your husband fails to be your husband, then you can\u2026 Oh it\u2019s a danger these days in divided homes, to make the son the husband and split his soul right in two. And so, that\u2019s my revelation of the morning.\n(J) The amazing thing to me with that is that the Husband, the heavenly Husband, will use the earthly Body. You can\u2019t be dogmatic about that; He will use the earthly Body. And I watched it during your sickness. Your need was met in a lot of different places, and the amazing thing was, is He was using the Body to bring the comfort, but the comfort wasn\u2019t \u2018in them\u2019. We were just doing what He was giving us to do to supply for you.\n(M) Oh, that\u2019s wonderful, John, because you know, it was like you very removed. In my heart, though I was terribly touched and terribly grateful and amazed, it was like you all were not there. Because I was so desperate for Him that I knew, because He was giving me what couldn\u2019t be logically explained. For instance, He sent me to the beach four times; and to the northeast ocean one time. And who would have thought that was a \u2018need\u2019. I never, I never even thought I was capable of traveling to that degree. And so, you\u2019re right.  And you were wonderfully loving and there and comforting, but you all didn\u2019t hover over me. You didn\u2019t come all the time; you came as you were led. And so He was really Head of the Church during my illness so that, so much so that I wasn\u2019t focused on needing you all at all. I wasn\u2019t there, I wasn\u2019t dependent, I wasn\u2019t entrusting myself to you to solve it. To me it was much bigger than anybody could solve.\n(J) He wasn\u2019t just Head; He was the Hand.\n(J) He literally was touching you and your situation through this Body, and, and ah, does that make sense?\n(M) Oh, absolutely. It makes me fall in love with Him right now, swoon.\n(J) Well, it was like, you know, the thumb and the forefinger and the pinkie, we were all moving, and I believe that for the most part we were all doing it unto Him. I was standing in the promise that He had given me for you. And I was listening. It wasn\u2019t like I was detached from you, I was very aware of you. But I wasn\u2019t aware, I wasn\u2019t involved in your exact circumstance in this point; that I was in a place of faith for your circumstance, so I couldn\u2019t look directly and be involved with your exact situation. Does that make sense?\n(M) Ohhhh. Oh yes it does.\n(J) Ok, so I wasn\u2019t involved with the illness. I was involved with what He was doing toward your illness at any given moment, but I was in a different place in my heart in faith that your illness was just momentary.\n(M) So your faith detached you from meeting my need; whoa.\n(M) From trying to be more than you could be to enable me. Enabling is trying to be the Husband to somebody that only Christ can be. My failing in most of my life has been enabling, trying to be a sufficiency to someone, and it\u2019s impossible.\n(J) It was so big that it was ah; it was possible. There was nothing I could do. How could I work out something that was completely out of my realm?\n(M) Yeah, and in this there was no\u2026 There was only building my health, but there was no medication, there was no relief.\n(J) And we did everything that could bring any kind of relief; we did it.\n(J) But ah, hmm.\n(M) Yeah, and ah, but it puts that\u2026 That puts this issue of Husband\u2026 See, I understand idolatry; I really understand idolatry, but this was about Husband, and that puts it into a much more intimate, personal place. And I went back to a favorite scripture with new eyes this morning. Hmmm, I think its Isaiah 30.\n(J) I love the fact that I wasn\u2019t a source; I was a conduit.\n(M) Yes, and that made me see Him. I wept in gratitude to Him and said, I have lived in a spa, I have been in a\u2026 I have been in a Kingdom during this time. Ok, this is Isaiah 30, verse 15. I remembered this. \u201cFor thus says the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel; in returning, or repentance and rest, you shall be saved; in quietness and trust shall be your strength.\u201d And then he goes on to say, \u201cBut you were unwilling.\u201d And the unwillingness goes on, \u2018I went flying to the world, to the horses\u2019. Verse 18, \u201cTherefore the Lord waits to be gracious to you.\u201d And in the Amplified this is so rich. \u201cTherefore He exalts Himself to show mercy to you. For the Lord is a God of justice.  You will scatter them as unclean things. You will say to them, be gone.\u201d And I think that\u2019s why my friend and I laughed so this morning, because we were saying \u2018be gone\u2019. You give me a lot of sustenance, but you are not Him. And if you gave me any sustenance, it was from Him.\n(M) If you gave me encouragement or a scripture or correction, it was Him.\n(M) Then, after you wait for Him, He longs, in the Amplified, He longs to be gracious. And He will\u2026 And what it means is He will come after our strength and our dependencies. And then He will give rain for the seed, livestock, ox and donkeys; every lofty mountain there will be brook\u2019s running with water. And the water is flowing from within, from the Husband. So that was, you know, \u201cin repentance and rest will be your strength.\u201d So, anyway, I\u2019m rejoicing this morning that I see the Husband, sort of in a different way, in a bigger, certainly a bigger way.\n", "prompt": "(M) But when it went to the husband as a source of comfort, love, understanding, listening, all those things, then it blew it up for me into that I am the woman at the well; And we all are; all of us are.

But our need is not just for a Father; it\u2019s for a Husband.\n(J) Hmm, hmm.\n(M) And really I think it\u2019s pretty accepted fact that Mary the Mother of Jesus was pretty much as child when the Holy Spirit came to her, fourteen probably. So Christ comes in to the child, and the child enters the Kingdom, and the Kingdom is\u2026 The King is a Husband, and God is the great Father. So it\u2019s, it\u2019s\u2026 the issue of Husband that Fabiola brought to us is exploding for me. And it\u2019s like the Holy Spirit comes to bring everything we need in relationship, that we cannot find in any other relationship remotely. It\u2019s like I told my \u2018divorcee\u2019, (Martha laughs) you can make your children your husband. If your husband fails to be your husband, then you can\u2026 Oh it\u2019s a danger these days in divided homes, to make the son the husband and split his soul right in two. And so, that\u2019s my revelation of the morning.\n(J) The amazing thing to me with that is that the Husband, the heavenly Husband, will use the earthly Body. You can\u2019t be dogmatic about that; He will use the earthly Body. And I watched it during your sickness. Your need was met in a lot of different places, and the amazing thing was, is He was using the Body to bring the comfort, but the comfort wasn\u2019t \u2018in them\u2019. We were just doing what He was giving us to do to supply for you.\n(M) Oh, that\u2019s wonderful, John, because you know, it was like you very removed. In my heart, though I was terribly touched and terribly grateful and amazed, it was like you all were not there. Because I was so desperate for Him that I knew, because He was giving me what couldn\u2019t be logically explained. For instance, He sent me to the beach four times; and to the northeast ocean one time. And who would have thought that was a \u2018need\u2019. I never, I never even thought I was capable of traveling to that degree. And so, you\u2019re right.  And you were wonderfully loving and there and comforting, but you all didn\u2019t hover over me. You didn\u2019t come all the time; you came as you were led. And so He was really Head of the Church during my illness so that, so much so that I wasn\u2019t focused on needing you all at all. I wasn\u2019t there, I wasn\u2019t dependent, I wasn\u2019t entrusting myself to you to solve it. To me it was much bigger than anybody could solve.\n(J) He wasn\u2019t just Head; He was the Hand.\n(J) He literally was touching you and your situation through this Body, and, and ah, does that make sense?\n(M) Oh, absolutely. It makes me fall in love with Him right now, swoon.\n(J) Well, it was like, you know, the thumb and the forefinger and the pinkie, we were all moving, and I believe that for the most part we were all doing it unto Him. I was standing in the promise that He had given me for you. And I was listening. It wasn\u2019t like I was detached from you, I was very aware of you. But I wasn\u2019t aware, I wasn\u2019t involved in your exact circumstance in this point; that I was in a place of faith for your circumstance, so I couldn\u2019t look directly and be involved with your exact situation. Does that make sense?\n(M) Ohhhh. Oh yes it does.\n(J) Ok, so I wasn\u2019t involved with the illness. I was involved with what He was doing toward your illness at any given moment, but I was in a different place in my heart in faith that your illness was just momentary.\n(M) So your faith detached you from meeting my need; whoa.\n(M) From trying to be more than you could be to enable me. Enabling is trying to be the Husband to somebody that only Christ can be. My failing in most of my life has been enabling, trying to be a sufficiency to someone, and it\u2019s impossible.\n(J) It was so big that it was ah; it was possible. There was nothing I could do. How could I work out something that was completely out of my realm?\n(M) Yeah, and in this there was no\u2026 There was only building my health, but there was no medication, there was no relief.\n(J) And we did everything that could bring any kind of relief; we did it.\n(J) But ah, hmm.\n(M) Yeah, and ah, but it puts that\u2026 That puts this issue of Husband\u2026 See, I understand idolatry; I really understand idolatry, but this was about Husband, and that puts it into a much more intimate, personal place. And I went back to a favorite scripture with new eyes this morning. Hmmm, I think its Isaiah 30.\n(J) I love the fact that I wasn\u2019t a source; I was a conduit.\n(M) Yes, and that made me see Him. I wept in gratitude to Him and said, I have lived in a spa, I have been in a\u2026 I have been in a Kingdom during this time. Ok, this is Isaiah 30, verse 15. I remembered this. \u201cFor thus says the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel; in returning, or repentance and rest, you shall be saved; in quietness and trust shall be your strength.\u201d And then he goes on to say, \u201cBut you were unwilling.\u201d And the unwillingness goes on, \u2018I went flying to the world, to the horses\u2019. Verse 18, \u201cTherefore the Lord waits to be gracious to you.\u201d And in the Amplified this is so rich. \u201cTherefore He exalts Himself to show mercy to you. For the Lord is a God of justice.  You will scatter them as unclean things. You will say to them, be gone.\u201d And I think that\u2019s why my friend and I laughed so this morning, because we were saying \u2018be gone\u2019. You give me a lot of sustenance, but you are not Him. And if you gave me any sustenance, it was from Him.\n(M) If you gave me encouragement or a scripture or correction, it was Him.\n(M) Then, after you wait for Him, He longs, in the Amplified, He longs to be gracious. And He will\u2026 And what it means is He will come after our strength and our dependencies. And then He will give rain for the seed, livestock, ox and donkeys; every lofty mountain there will be brook\u2019s running with water. And the water is flowing from within, from the Husband. So that was, you know, \u201cin repentance and rest will be your strength.\u201d So, anyway, I\u2019m rejoicing this morning that I see the Husband, sort of in a different way, in a bigger, certainly a bigger way.\n\ncreative_story", "original_prompt": "creative_story", "full_output": "(M) But when it went to the husband as a source of comfort, love, understanding, listening, all those things, then it blew it up for me into that I am the woman at the well; And we all are; all of us are. She is the New Testament Gomer, and that\u2019s why Jesus revealed His identity to her, and this is the one the Father seeks to worship Him, and to receive Jesus as Husband.\n(J) I mean she gave\u2026 He gave her the, the New Testament worship. I mean He, He\u2026 Everything pivoted on what He said to her.\n(M) And the most amazing thing is that the spring of water would be within her. Not outside, not up in heaven, not a relationship, but in the true union of Husband and wife, the true internal oneness where the source would be Him within. And the spring, as we saw when I was so sick, the spring was bubbling in spite of me. I had nothing to do with the bubbling of the spring. It was flowing because He places Himself within us as the Church, and as His Bride, and as the Believer. And I think in terms of childlikeness, that\u2019s the level ground for male and female.  And that\u2019s why it says, \u201cthere\u2019s neither Greek nor Jew, nor male nor female.\u201d In the Church those distinctions are obliterated because we are all children; that helps me understand. If a man is willing to come down to that level of weakness and receptivity, to live by being sustained outside of yourself, if a man can come there, he has come to being a child. If a woman will stop looking to a man, and come down to need, her need is for God, that no man can possibly meet, then we are all, we are all on the same ground as children. So we, I think C.S. Lewis is the one that said we are so feminine in comparison to God that we are all as female. We are so receptor\u2019s that we are all female. But I like\u2026 I think I can see it easier as being a child who must receive all and owns nothing. So when we are all children together, as very much we are in this Body, then we are all on equal ground of need.

There are lots of programs out there, some that are better than others, all designed to keep you in the game. One program that has great results, is the McKenzie Method, and it can be applied to almost any injury. But where did this method come from?\n\nThe origin of the McKenzie Method\n\nDr. Robin McKenzie was born in New Zealand on December 7th, 1931. He grew up in the south and enjoyed the outdoors, in particular, he loved the ocean and would spend much of his free time surfing. He had many injuries over the years but did his best to play through them. He attended Massey University and had a double degree in anatomy and physiology. When Dr. McKenzie returned home after college, he worked with his father in the shipping business.\n\nOn January 25th, 1956, after a hard day\u2019s work in the shipyard, Dr. McKenzie fell and suffered a rupture of the posterior facet joints in his spine. He was sent home to recuperate with a prescription for aspirin and a brace. He did neither. As an anatomy student, he was well aware of what had happened and was not happy to have no better option than painkillers. After a week of rest, he resumed his usual lifestyle but found relief only when he began to move his back.\n\nHe would start in a chair, then stand, and finally lie flat. For each position he would spend a few minutes before progressing to the next. He would repeat this a few times a day and was amazed to find he felt better. This was the beginning of his lifelong study of the spine. He had found that movement was a solution for his pain and began to develop the concept of mechanical diagnosis and therapeutics.\n\nAfter his initial injury, Dr. McKenzie began to investigate his symptoms with help from others in the medical community. He would experiment with certain motions and try to make sense of what they were doing, recording his findings in a notebook. He would spend hours watching patients lie on their spines, and then ask them to take a piece of paper and draw the areas of their pain. He also studied film and cadaver dissections and would even watch patients undergoing surgery.\n\nWhile still working in the shipping business, Dr. McKenzie became an apprentice at the Auckland Physiotherapy School.

But if you want your character to make flash and be successful then *I don't think* you should waste your time fretting about UE and automated systems. They're there, and you should use them, but *I think* you'll enjoy yourself much more if these are just secondary considerations rather than driving factors.\nWe've all been new, and we've all done the bit where we watch the tutorials, etc, blah, blah, but go do it again!\nI've watched a few of Slither's tutorials again, and I hope I've taken something away that's going to make me more enjoyable to interact with, and make my character better at what my character does.\nHope this was in some way useful to at least someone... go out and RP with people, you don't need money, or badass skills, or automated income to get stuff done.\nAs The Beatles song so wisely put it, all you need is chummers.\nI think a big problem comes from the fact that Sindome looks like a grinding-style MUD, with the slow progression, complex character building, and rich skills system. While I'd probably get quite a few people mad if I said that Sindome is more of a talker MOO, that's kind of how I see it and it has been very useful in framing what I want to do in the game and how.\nNow before you raise your pitchforks and deathmatch me to prove that Sindome has mechanical substance... that's not what I mean with Sindome being a talker. Sure, it's not a chatroom, but a lot of what happens in Sindome happen through \"conversation\", which range from actual talking, to SIC, posting on the Grid, or posing and emoting.\nWhen I started playing Sindome I was expecting it to be a simulator style MOO where you grind the relevant skill that you want and then base all your activity around using it, but that's not how it works here. A combat character in Sindome needs to talk and RP more than they need to type 'kill', a decker needs to talk and RP more than they need to crack nodes, a Fixer... well you get the idea.\nI'm just saying that if you think there is a way to find enjoyment out of Sindome without talking or roleplaying and doing things that don't require skill rolls most of the time... well, maybe you could try that. But in my opinion, Sindome is built more for you to pose, emote, and talk in, and the mechanics are there just to ground you in the setting's reality rather than to be something you focus too much on. Don't fall into the trap of \"grinding\" in Sindome hoping things will get fun at some point. Think of Sindome as a roleplay with some gaming, not as a game with some roleplaying.\nI think both sides of this argument have their points. The problem is when the importance of UE is discussed, most are not looking at it with an open mind and dive off of the deep end with extreme examples. What the conversation doesn't need is grandstanding \"vets\" who use it as an opportunity to tell people how to play Sindome with their self inflated tales or lecture them with the virtues of peer interactions, as you could see in OOC-chat, really gets nowhere fast. I'm sure these players asking in good faith about UE stuff are interacting with other people and trying to do the things they keep getting lectured on.\nThe thing is, UE is important, and you have to recognize that, and you have to accept that it is more important to some and less to others. UE is absolutely needed for coded progression. It is not a bad thing or a sign of a terrible player to want to codedly progress either. Many jobs, many actions, and many opportunities are definitely behind a UE wall.\nThe argument that you do not need UE is half true though. It is not required to interact with other players, build connections, get behind a cause, or get into some organizations or jobs.\nThe only thing I think that would help people process this is for the RP virtue signalers to hold their personal tales and talking down to these newer players like they are playing Sindome wrong or doing something in bad faith, and for the people who are complaining about the rate of progression speed to understand that the speed is there for you to learn and advance both oocly and icly, and appreciate it in that sense. You can tell someone all day how to do something but they are not going to be efficient with things until they try them out.\nTLDR UE is important, but not required for the MAJORITY of RP in Sindome but totes required for coded systems progression and it would all be nice if both sides of the table appreciated that.\nYou're right, personally I might be projecting my own experience and worrying too much about new players burning out, but maybe said burnout \"builds character\".\nI've been here a few months and would still consider myself a very new player. There's a lot in the game I don't know, but as I've mentioned before, this is not my first rodeo with an in-depth RPI.\nPersonally, I find there is a balance between mechanics and story. I came here for the story, not the mechanics, which is why I tend to forget about things like UE and stats. I learned the hard way that they have their place, but I really believe it should be story first, mechanics second.\nWhile Sindome certainly has it's PVP mechanics (which doesn't necessarily mean combat; most of the PVP I've seen has nothing to do with combat), it's a roleplaying game and I feel sad sometimes to see folks really bent out of shape about stats and UE, because that means the story is going missing. This is a blunt opinion of mine, but if I wanted to play a stats game, it wouldn't be Sindome. It would be a video game, with you know, video, and not text-based. Sindome fulfills my love of cyberpunk, of surviving the dark, and either doing really well or going face down in the dirt.\nI like the advice that UE is important, because, as Grizzly said, there's coded systems here that affect our stories. But I really feel it's story first, coded systems second. I've always felt the coded systems support the RP, not the other way around, and I find I have a lot more fun that way.\nI agree with DoveCage.

There are a lot of reasons to do things differently, but the truth is it doesn't matter how much you know about the game - a lot of the time you still need other players to achieve anything worthwhile.\nNew characters are totally useful. You can start a new character with 0 UE at any point in the game and still have fun with that character and still make a mark in the game and become known to those in power. Hell, if your RP is good enough and your ideas cool enough, you might be more well-known than people with much higher UE.\n@Creative_Story, you make an excellent point, and I do feel that I was over-generalizing by calling all newbies useless. Perhaps I should have used the phrase \"newbie mistakes\". I think this is part of the problem with these kind of discussions, a lot of people assume that what one player does is an inherent part of the game as opposed to just a specific way to play it.\nIf you don't want to be told how to play Sindome and that there's more than one way to do so, this is not the thread for you. All I'm saying here is that there are multiple avenues to take in the game, and people here shouldn't act like new characters can't have impact or be fun and engaging.\nNew characters can be fun, and have impact, and even make a name for themselves. But as Grizzly said, they should do so within the confines of the powerlevel the character starts with. In my experience, the players who try to skip this stage and \"jump in at the deep end\" tend not to stick around. And those that do usually make mistakes that can cause issues for other players, like dropping huge amounts of money into a new shop, or buying all sorts of high-EU gear.\nSo in that sense, you can do anything you want to, but the advice I'm giving is that it's probably better to learn how to do things the 'right way' before you do them so you can learn from your mistakes and not repeat them when your skill and UE finally reaches the level that you actually need them at.\nOh yeah,", "completion_only": "is right.

Everything is fine but this lan school software.  This is something we've always used and it was fine with XP on 1 machine.  When we started using the 2008 version, and we had multiple machines to manage, we kept getting \"there was an unexpected problem connecting to the computer\" and had to use remote access, and use each remote access computer from that computer, and so on and so forth...

Doctors found a small piece of plastic in her stomach, which was later taken out with surgery. It turns out the plastic came from a fake breast implant. The implants have been on the market for years. They are made in countries like India and China. They are illegal in the U.S. \n  \n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last week that the implants -- which can sometimes cause pain and infections -- are part of a worldwide \"epidemic\" of fake breast implants. \n  \n \"In the last 12 years, this is by far the most number of (implant-related health) events we've seen,\" said the FDA spokeswoman Morgan Liscinsky. \n  \n The patient's implant came from a South Florida clinic. She's not sure how long she had it. She said she found the fake-looking implant -- which was not FDA approved -- online. \n  \n When she woke up from surgery, the FDA spokeswoman said she was surprised to find an implant that looked exactly like the one she'd originally put in herself. \n  \n \"It was the same size, shape, look and feel,\" said Morgan Liscinsky of the FDA. \n  \n The implants from the clinic she said she bought online are also being investigated by the FDA.

Doctors found a small piece of plastic in her stomach, which was later taken out with surgery. It turns out the plastic came from a fake breast implant. The implants have been on the market for years. They are made in countries like India and China. They are illegal in the U.S. \n  \n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last week that the implants -- which can sometimes cause pain and infections -- are part of a worldwide \"epidemic\" of fake breast implants. \n  \n \"In the last 12 years, this is by far the most number of (implant-related health) events we've seen,\" said the FDA spokeswoman Morgan Liscinsky. \n  \n The patient's implant came from a South Florida clinic. She's not sure how long she had it. She said she found the fake-looking implant -- which was not FDA approved -- online. \n  \n When she woke up from surgery, the FDA spokeswoman said she was surprised to find an implant that looked exactly like the one she'd originally put in herself. \n  \n \"It was the same size, shape, look and feel,\" said Morgan Liscinsky of the FDA. \n  \n The implants from the clinic she said she bought online are also being investigated by the FDA.
