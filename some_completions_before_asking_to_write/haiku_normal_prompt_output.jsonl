Instead, it is a poem that expresses the speaker's thoughts and emotions on a particular subject in a conversational, natural tone. In fact, the poet is the speaker of this poem. Lyric poems usually address subjects such as love, nature, or grief. The lyric poem is one of the most common forms. It can stand alone or it can be incorporated into other longer forms, such as the sonnet. Common forms of lyric poetry include the ballad, the ode, the elegy, the villanelle, the sestina, and the haiku.\n\n\nNarrative poem: A poem that tells a story.\n\nOctameter: A line of eight syllables, with two groups of four syllables.\n\n\nOde: A lyric poem written in praise of something, usually of an exalted nature, such as a person, animal, object, or idea.\n\nOttava rima: A form of rhyming verse in which each stanza consists of eight lines rhymed ABABABCC. A Shakespearean sonnet is an example of ottava rima.\n\nPantoum: A fixed form in which the second and fourth lines of each stanza are repeated as the first and third lines of the next stanza, while each successive stanza is an octave of iambic tetrameter alternating with an alexandrine. This form originated in Malay and Javanese verse. Poet Charles Harper Webb's \"The Night My Father Didn't Come Home\" is a pantoum.\n\n\nPetrarchan sonnet: Named for the Italian poet Petrarch, a son", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 6, "avg_token_entropy": 1.2709923855960374, "avg_token_perplexity": 5.875253332334789, "prompt_type": "normal_prompt"}

Some Japanese haikus do not follow the 5-7-5 mora format, instead they are written in 1 line with 31 moras. There are usually 17 kana (Japanese characters) in the line.

This particular form of poetry is easy to read and write because it is so simple. It only consists of three lines with no rhyme scheme.\n\nThe first line of this poem introduces the title. It describes what kind of person I am based on my current situation.\n\nThe second line goes on to describe something about myself that is not so pleasant. It reveals that I have not been getting enough sleep lately due to all the work I\u2019ve been putting in at the office.\n\nThe third and final line describes something humorous or ironic happening at the office, which causes me to laugh and feel better after reading it.\n\nHaikus are funny, but they\u2019re also serious. They\u2019re meant to be enjoyed by people with a sense of humor. They\u2019re also meant to bring you some relief from all the hard work you put into life and career. This is why they\u2019re so effective in making you laugh and smile when things get tough and make you want to cry when life gets really hard.\n\nA good example of a haiku is A Good Poem Should Make You Laugh. This poem consists of three lines with no rhyme scheme but it does have an underlying theme that is funny if you\u2019re able to appreciate it.\n\nThis is just one example of what a good haiku should be like.

You decide to go and look for them, but when you get to where you saw them last, you find that there is nothing there. What happened to your friends? Are they still in the forest somewhere? If so, where did they go?

I'm having trouble understanding the last line and the \"What are the odds?\" part and that is throwing me off. I don't know if I like it or not.\n\n    What is \"the luckiest day ever\" and why is that lucky?

Is it an engaging poem?\n\n  4. Anonymous2/21/2011\n\n    I know this is very difficult, but sometimes I don't even know what the point is with certain poems.

{"prompt": "Write a haiku:", "full_output": "Write a haiku: a haiku is an ancient, traditional poetic form in which the poet has a limited number of syllables to play with: five, followed by seven, followed by five again. The subject of the haiku is nature: the poem typically describes a season, or a small event in a larger cycle of the seasons. Often the haiku is about an image of nature that is somehow surprising or startling. The poet then comments on this image through the feelings or observations it stirs. Haiku tend to capture a moment of intense perception; one way to do this is to include sensory details that bring the reader into the scene: what could you see, hear, feel, smell, or taste?\n\nA haiku in English is typically written in three lines; this is not the only form that works, but it is a common one. Haiku are sometimes written in such a way that a break between the lines is natural. The form of the haiku allows the poet to comment on an image, but not to explain everything about the image. Haiku often have their own internal logic; the meaning of the haiku should be felt or experienced rather than explained.\u00a0Here\u2019s an example of a haiku:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 autumn sky\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the last leaf falls.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -- Takashi Matsuoka\n\nIn this poem, the subject is the autumn sky, as evidenced by the use of the word \u201cautumn\u201d and the reference to clouds. The poet observes that the last leaf of the season is falling, and this is somehow connected to the clouds in the sky. The last leaf falling might be seen to suggest that the season is over, or that time is passing, or that something is coming to an end. The meaning of this haiku could be related to larger cycles of change, such as the passing of the seasons, the passage of a lifetime, or the end of one thing and the beginning of another. But the poet does not explain this in detail; instead, he or she depends on the reader to feel the connection between the cloud, the leaf, and the season. Haiku also allow the poet to connect things or ideas that are not directly related in a literal sense.

A haiku usually makes a statement about the natural world, and the images it creates should be clear and direct, and allow a reader to draw their own conclusions.\n\nWhat is a haiku?\n\nA haiku is a form of unrhymed poetry with roots in 16th century Japan. It was first written by a Buddhist monk named Matsuo Bash\u014d. The form is simple: written in three lines with five, seven, and five syllables (5-7-5), the poem should use direct images to create a deeper picture. Haiku often focus on the seasons or nature, and have no titles. Traditional haiku poets do not use rhyme, and do not use the words \"I\", \"my\", or \"me\". Instead, haiku writers create images of the natural world to show how they are feeling, rather than explicitly state their emotions. Haiku do not need to make sense or be logical: it is up to the reader to create their own meaning. Haiku are very short, and usually focus on a specific moment or feeling, rather than being about something large or complicated.\n\nWhen was this written?\n\nAlthough the origins of this poem are unknown, it was first printed in the journal Haiku World. The poem's author is unknown, and it is not clear if it was written for publication or for personal enjoyment.\n\nThe poem was written in 1952, during the postwar period in Japan. During this time, many traditional poets, like Bash\u014d and Issa, were becoming popular again. This may explain why there are so many references to nature in the poem.\n\nIn the poem, the author is reflecting on the passage of time. He writes that even though the year has passed, his love for his beloved has not changed. The poem is a reminder that love is timeless and does not change with the seasons.\n\nWhat is the tone of this poem?\n\nThe tone of this poem is optimistic and hopeful. The poet writes that although life may be difficult, there is always something to look forward to. He also writes that he is not alone in his struggle, and that other people are going through similar difficulties.
