Caspases are key mediators of apoptosis and inflammation; deregulation of their activation or expression can lead to the development of conditions such as neurodegenerative and autoinflammatory disorders. This review details the different caspase-associated disorders while focusing on caspase-1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy. Problems facing the development of effective and safe caspase therapeutics will also be addressed.\n\n\n\u2022 Introduction \u2022 Activation of caspases -Activation of apoptotic caspases -Activation of inflammatory caspases -Interleukins, their activation by caspases and their role in inflammation \u2022 Small molecule inhibitors of caspase activity and activation -Modification of caspase activation -Synthetic molecules as inhibitors of caspase activity \u2022 Role of caspases in disease -Caspases as targets in conditions associated with increased levels of apoptosis -Neurodegenerative disease -Ischaemia -Ischaemia/reperfusion injury -implications in transplant injury -Inflammatory diseases -Role of caspases in sepsis -mediators of apoptosis and inflammation -Role of caspase-1 and -12 in sepsis -Role of apoptotic caspases in sepsis Introduction\nCysteine aspartyl-specific proteases (caspases) are a family of proteases that cleave substrates at sites next to aspartic acid residues. These proteases are executioners of the cell and also have a role in inflammation and differentiation. There are a total of 14 mammalian caspases thus far identified, 12 of which are human (namely caspases 1-10, 12 and 14). The caspases are divided into two groups, dependent on their main function. Members, who act in the process of apoptosis, are one group and include caspases 2, 3 and 6-10. The second group are involved in maturation of cytokines and include caspase-1, -4, -5 and -12 [1,2]. These caspases are present in the cell as inactive zymogens consisting of a prodomain followed by a P20 subunit and P10 subunit, which contain substrate recognition and catalytic domains. Activated caspases cleave a variety of substrates with approximately 400 targets having been identified to date. These include proteins involved in signal transduction (apoptosis regulators, cytokines, serine/threonine kinases), structural proteins (cytoskeletal and nuclear) and proteins involved in regulation of transcription, translation and RNA editing [3,4]. In contrast to the apoptotic and inflammatory caspases, the precise function of caspase-14 remains undefined. However, a role in keratinocyte differentiation has been determined [5][6][7].\n\nActivation of inflammatory caspases\nThe inflammatory caspases (1, 4, 5 and 12) are involved in cytokine maturation and consequently the inflammatory response. Caspase-1 was the first caspase identified and was discovered in 1989 by Black et al. while attempting to determine the protease responsible for the cleavage of interleukin-1\u2424 (IL-1\u2424) [25]. Subsequent research, utilizing caspase-1-deficient animal models, demonstrated the requirement of caspase-1 for IL-1\u2424 maturation [26,27] Caspase-1 is also involved in the cleavage and activation of interleukin-18  and interleukin-33 (IL-33) [28][29][30]. A role of caspase-1 in neuronal apoptosis has been proposed. Caspase-1-deficient mice have demonstrated normal developmental cell death [26,27], however, these models have also shown resistance to cerebral ischaemic injury and also Rip2 and trophic factor withdrawal-mediated neuronal cell death [31][32][33]. Whether caspase-1 has a direct apoptotic role in these models is unclear, further research is required to determine the true function of caspase-1 in neuronal apoptosis. In contrast, caspase-5 is involved only in IL-1\u2424 cleavage [15]. It is believed that caspase-4 and -5 arose from gene duplication due to their sequence homology [1], although the role of caspase-4 in inflammation needs to be elucidated further.\nActivation of inflammatory caspases requires assembly of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex whose main component is the Nalp proteins, part of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family. These proteins contain the nucleotide binding domain NACHT and the leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain of 20-29 residues [34]. There are 14 human Nalp proteins so far, Nalp 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 and 12 have been shown to modulate caspase-1 activation [15,[35][36][37][38][39], the mechanism by which these proteins facilitate this activation is not fully understood. Nalp 1, the first Nalp protein to be discovered, contains a pyrin (PYD) domain, NACHT domain, five LRR domains similar to other Nalp proteins but also contains an F-interacting domain (FIIND) and a CARD at its carboxy terminal [34].\nThe proposed mechanism of caspase-1 activation in the Nalp 1 inflammasome involves the recruitment of an adaptor molecule known as apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (Asc) through the PYD domain of Nalp 1 [16]. Asc then recruits caspase-1 through its CARD domain while Caspase-5 recruitment occurs through the CARD domain of Nalp 1 [15]. The assembled Nalp 1 inflammasome is believed to facilitate the dimerization and activation of caspase-1 and -5 [15]. In contrast, the Nalp 3 inflammasome activates only caspase-1 and contains the adaptor Asc along with cardinal, a second adapter protein [37].\nWhile lipopolysaccharide (LPS), uric acid crystals and ATP are known inducers of caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u2424 processing [46][47][48], to date, only bacterial muramyl dipeptide has been identified as directly inducing inflammasome formation [49]. The mechanism by which these molecules activate the inflammasome is unknown. Evidence suggests the involvement of signal transduction through the LRR domain of Nalps and changes in potassium levels due to cellular stress [49,50]. Recently  Owing to the diverse role of these interleukins in inflammation, modulation of caspase-1 provides an efficient means of controlling interleukin activation and the ensuing onset of the inflammatory response.\n\nModification of caspase activation\nResearch into the utilization of modulators of caspase activation in the treatment of certain conditions offers a novel therapeutic approach. These modulators may indirectly activate or repress caspase activation by targeting the proteins involved in caspase activation such as Apaf-1 of the apoptosome [61,62]. Direct modification of caspase activity is also possible through the use of molecules such as peptides, which bind the active site of caspases.\nCaspase regulation may also occur through binding of molecules to allosteric sites. Inhibition of caspases-1, -3 and -7 has been reported through binding of thiol-containing inhibitors to cysteine residues of allosteric sites. The conformational changes produced by inhibitor binding are similar to those found in the inactive form of these caspases and culminates in the prevention of peptide binding in the active site [63,64]. This review will focus on caspase inhibition via active site binding as the therapeutic potential and clinical effects of caspase inhibitors are based largely on this type of inhibitor.\n\nSynthetic molecules as inhibitors of caspase activity\nInitially, peptide-based small molecular inhibitors of caspases were developed based on the cleavage sites of caspase substrates such as DEVD site of PARP. These molecules took advantage of the requirement of caspases for an aspartic acid at the P1 position of the substrate [2]. Specificity of these caspase inhibitors is influenced by the preference of different caspases for certain amino acids in positions P2 to P5 of the active site.\nPosition P4 is a key determinant for specificity; inflammatory caspases prefer large aromatic or hydrophobic amino acids at this position with the preferred cleavage site sequence of WEHD.\nCaspase-2, -3 and -7 prefer an aspartic acid at P4 whereas caspases-6, -8 and -9 prefer large aliphatic side chains and the sequence (L/V)EXD [2]. Caspase-2 prefers an additional substrate interaction, favouring small hydrophobic residues at position P5 [65]. Specificity data for several caspase inhibitors are illustrated in Table 1. These data demonstrate the preference of caspases for certain amino acids. It must be noted, however, that the specificity of inhibitors may alter within biological systems where cross-reactivity with abundant non-target caspases may occur [66].\nInitial modifications to peptide-based inhibitors involved the addition of electrophilic groups on the P1 aspartic acid residue such as aldehydes, nitriles or ketones to produce reversible inhibitors. These inhibitors have demonstrated low potency in cell-based systems possibly due to inability to reach necessary concentrations to inhibit sufficient caspase activation [67,68]. In\n\nIC50 value Caspase 1 Caspase 4 Caspase 5 Caspase 3 Caspase 7 Caspase 6 Caspase 2 Caspase 8 Caspase 9 Caspase 10\nReference contrast, the addition of chloro, fluoro-, acyloxy, or diazomethyl ketones produces more potent irreversible inhibitors [69]. Several adaptations have been made to these reversible and irreversible inhibitors to improve cell penetration and stability allowing for the development of effective therapeutics. A number of P2 and P3 replacements have been developed; mainly pyridone, pyrimidone and pyridazinodiazepine scaffolds [70,71]. Non-peptide caspase inhibitors are also currently in development. So far, non-peptide molecules that have been described include isatin sulfonamides and onilinoquinazolines [72,73]. At\n\nRole of caspases in disease\nCaspases are key mediators of apoptosis and inflammation, the loss or gain of caspase activity/expression is the basis of a number of diseases caused by deregulation of the apoptotic and inflammatory pathways. While important diseases are associated with a lack of caspase activity (e.g. cancer where apoptosis is typically decreased), this review will focus on those diseases and conditions associated with increased caspase activity, as it is in these cases that the role of caspases as therapeutic targets is most clear. The role of caspases in neurodegenerative diseases is still unclear; identification of caspase activity in these diseases is not evidence of a causal role of caspases or the implication of a beneficial effect upon caspase inhibition. Research into disease progression performed with animal models offers an insight into these conditions, however animal models must be chosen carefully. For example, the use of certain neurotoxins that mimic PD may not give a true representation of the disease pathology in human beings. The use of caspase inhibitors as therapeutic agents will prove difficult until the mechanisms behind disease progression are elucidated.\n\nIschaemia\nIschaemia is the restriction of blood supply to tissue, the subsequent return of blood flow is known as reperfusion. Ischaemia leads to increased pH, ATP depletion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which initiate signalling cascades leading to cell death and inflammation. Ischaemia-induced cell death may occur by apoptosis, necrosis or autophagy [98], and the factors that determine the extent to which each of these pathways contribute to cell death during ischaemia is largely unknown.\n\nIschaemia/reperfusion injuryimplications in transplant injury\nA major obstacle of organ transplantation is ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which occurs in the course of organ preservation and subsequent transplant to the recipient. The use of caspase inhibitors may offer a therapeutic strategy to reduce transplant injury and failure as an increase in apoptotic cells and caspase activity has been reported in transplanted organs including the heart, kidneys, liver, lungs and pancreas [109][110][111][112][113].\nThe irreversible pan-caspase inhibitor IDN6556 has been tested in a rat model of lung transplantation [114]. The beneficial effects of IDN6556 on transplanted lung function was dependant on length of cold ischaemia storage with a significant increase in lung function when grafts were stored for 18 hrs, transplanted and reperfused for 2 hrs.\nIDN6556 is currently in clinical trials for use during liver transplantation. A Phase II trial demonstrated that addition of this caspase inhibitor to organ preservation solution significantly reduced apoptosis and caspase-3 and -7 activity after reperfusion. However, additional administration of this inhibitor to the recipient abrogated this reduction leading to apoptotic levels similar to placebo, together with increased levels of neutrophil infiltration in the liver. IDN6556 administration did not reduce the rate of acute cellular rejection in this trial [75].\nThe use of caspase inhibitors to reduce I/R injury in transplant organ does show promise due to the short-term nature of treatment. Addition of caspase inhibitors to organ preservation solution also allows for selective treatment of target cells. Further research is required to determine the contribution of apoptotic cell death in I/R transplant injury in order to establish the therapeutic benefits of caspase inhibition.\nIDN6556 has also been utilized in the treatment of liver disease such as hepatitis. Clinical trials performed with IDN6556 have demonstrated a reduction in transaminase levels, which are markers for hepatic injury. However, transaminase levels returned to pre-treatment levels following discontinuation of IDN6556 treatment [76,115] suggesting chronic drug treatment may be required. This could be problematic due to the increased risk of adverse side effects that accompany long-term treatment.\n\nDeregulation of the inflammatory response can lead to the development of autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Caspases activate a number of key cytokines required for the inflammatory response. Therefore, caspases represent a target for drugs to prevent induction of this response in inflammatory diseases.\nMutations that lead to defects in the components of the inflammasome effect caspase-1 activation and therefore affect the inflammatory response by altering interleukin activation. [116,117] [116,118]. Caspase-1 inhibition may also be beneficial in the treatment of the auto-inflammatory disorder, familial Mediterranean fever which is associated with mutations of the pyrin protein [119,120]. Mutations in this protein can lead to induction of Asc oligomerization and inflammasome assembly in vitro [121]. Pyrin may also bind to caspase-1 directly [122].\n\n. The reasons for this increase in activity in response to NACHT domain mutations of nalp 3 are unknown. In principle, mutations may enhance inflammasome assembly as the NACHT domain is involved in oligomerization or mutations may reduce the binding of inhibitory proteins to Nalp 3 [37]. The caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 may have the potential to be used in the treatment of familial cold urticaria and other autoinflammatory diseases. The treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and whole blood from familial cold urticaria patients with VX-765 suppresses LPS-induced IL-1\u2424 activation\nAutoimmune disorders occur due to deregulation of the inflammatory response causing self-directed inflammation mediated through the adaptive immune response. Disorders include rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Regulation of interleukins through modulation of caspase activity may provide a method to control these disorders. The caspase- 1\n\ninhibitor Pralnacasan has been utilized in the treatment of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. DSS-induced colitis is a model for human inflammatory bowel disease. Combined treatment with DSS and Pralnacasan showed reduction in inflammatory cells, IL-18 levels in colons and INF-\u2425 in para-aortal lymph nodes compared with the DSS/placebo group [123]. In a separate study, cytokine expression was investigated in DSS-treated mice. DSS treatment led to an increase in IL-18, TNF-\u2423, IL-12 and INF-\u2425 protein levels with Pralnacasan suppressing the increase of IL-18, IL-1\u2424, TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) [124].\nPralnacasan is a peptidomimetic compound containing a pyridazinodiazepine scaffold at the P2-P3 site, which selectively inhibits caspase-1, demonstrating IC50 values of 1.3 nM, 2.3 M and 0.12 M for caspase-1, -3 and -8, respectively [74]. Upon administration, the ethoxyl group of the compound is hydrolyzed producing the active compound RU36384/VRT-018858 [125]. [126].\n\nPralnacasan inhibits LPS-induced IL-1\u2424 release and S. aureus cowan-induced IL-1\u2424 and IL-18 release in human PBMC. In a mouse model, Pralnacasan also suppresses IL-1\u2424 release induced by LPS injection\nIn 2001, data on the effect of Pralnacasan in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were published. Oral administration of Pralnacasan in DBA/1 mice with established collagen-induced arthritis reduced paw inflammation and disease progression. A reduction in cartilage damage and bone erosion in Pralnacasan treated mice compared to vehicle treated mice was also reported.\nThe use of Pralnacasan was also extended to osteoarthritis (OA). Treatment in two murine models of knee OA showed lower histopathological scores and a reduction in hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) /lysylpyridinoline (LP) ratio of collagen cross-links in the urine indicating a reduction in cartilage degradation. In this study, OA was induced in Balb/c mice by injection of bacterial collagenases, STR/1N mice were also utilized due to their ability to develop OA spontaneously [125]. Clinical  The use of caspase-1 inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory diseases has proved successful in a number of trials. However, adverse side effects, such as liver fibrosis, associated with caspase modulation pose a major obstacle in the development of caspase therapeutics and will be discussed in more detail in later sections. [127]. [128]. The mechanisms by which caspases contribute to sepsis include the release of cytokines and induction of apoptosis, the degree to which these processes contribute to sepsis is largely unknown.\n\nRole of caspase-1 and -12 in sepsis\nThe mechanism by which caspase-1 mediates its response in sepsis is not fully understood but is believed to involve the activation of interleukins through the inflammasome. IL-18 activation stimulates the inflammatory response by INF-\u2425 production and T-cell polarization and may act as a predictive factor for lethal sepsis [129]. Additionally, caspase-1 activation of IL-1\u2424 leads to the upregulation of pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor in neutrophils inhibiting apoptosis of these cells [130,131]. Delayed neutrophil apoptosis has been reported to occur during sepsis [132,133]. Neutrophil numbers are usually tightly regulated in vivo by the induction of apoptosis approximately 5 hrs after maturation [134], delayed apoptosis leads to an increase in neutrophil numbers contributing to hyperresponsive immunity and the symptoms of SIRS. A role of caspase-1 independent of cytokines Il-1\u2424 and IL-18 in sepsis has also been proposed following a study utilizing a murine model of sepsis. Caspase-1 knockout mice but not IL-1\u2424/IL-18 double knockout mice demonstrated increased survival and protection from splenic B lymphocyte apoptosis [135].\nThe full-length version of inflammatory caspase-12 (casp12-L) is implicated in sepsis. Casp-12-L confers hyporesponsiveness to LPS as measured by cytokine release and is associated with increased mortality rates in patients with severe sepsis [53]. This\n\nRole of apoptotic caspases in sepsis\nThe apoptotic caspases also play a part in the development of sepsis. Increased lymphocyte apoptosis may occur in sepsis contributing to the symptoms of CARS. Reduced levels of B-, CD4 T-and dendritic cells have been reported in septic patients and also in animal models of sepsis [133,136,137]. Caspase-2, -3, -6 and -9 have been implicated in lymphocyte apoptosis [138] and prevention of lymphocyte apoptosis by caspase inhibitors improves survival in sepsis models [137,139]. Lymphocyte apoptosis not only contribute to CARS by reducing the number of Band T-cells, but also the uptake of apoptotic cells can lead to macrophage and dendritic cell non-responsiveness known as anergy [140].\nThe utilization of caspase therapeutics may prove problematic in the case of sepsis due to lack of knowledge regarding the complex nature of sepsis development and progression and also the diverse roles that caspases may perform in this condition.\n\nChallenges facing the development of caspase therapeutics\nIn the development of a safe and effective caspase therapeutics, a number of criteria, such as drug specificity and selectivity, must be considered. This section highlights some of the key questions, which must be addressed in the development of caspase therapeutics.\nFirstly, an understanding of the contribution of apoptosis to cell death in the condition to be treated is essential, along with knowledge of the caspases implicated and the therapeutic window for treatment. As described in previous sections, apoptosis may not account for all cell death occurring in a certain condition. In ischaemia/reperfusion injury, three types of cell death may take place, namely apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis. Use of caspase inhibitors may only partially block cell death in this situation [141].\nTrials designed to determine the effectiveness and potency of caspase therapeutics in the prevention of apoptosis must consider appropriate techniques to detect apoptosis. The hallmarks of apoptosis include chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing and cleavage of a variety of caspase substrates. A study by Methot et al. reported a 3.5-fold increase in caspase inhibitor concentration required to inhibit DNA fragmentation by 95% compared to the concentration required to reduce \u2423 II spectrin cleavage by 95% in primary thymocytes [142]. This study illustrates the importance of accurate determination of apoptosis in the evaluation of caspase inhibitors.\nFollowing on from this, detection of apoptosis performed with these parameters does not give an indication of cell death occurring through apoptosis independent pathways, leading to the question: will inhibition of caspase activation protect cells from death? Evidence that cells are not protected includes the study of OCI-AML3 cells treated with a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs, which lead to activation of caspase-2, -3, -7, -8 and -9, and also PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. The caspase inhibitors IDN-1529 and IDN-1965 blocked apoptosis as determined by the above parameters. Cell death, however, was not prevented in these cells as determined by cell number, release of Cytochrome c, Smac and Omi from the mitochondria and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) [143]. In a second study, Bax-induced death in Jurkat cells demonstrated the features of apoptosis; however, caspase inhibition performed with Z-VAD-fmk in these cells led to cell death induced by loss of MMP [144].\n\nRole of caspases in other aspects of cell death\nThere are a number of different cell death pathways including autophagy, necrosis and mitotic catastrophe. The type of cell death chosen as well as the degree of overlap between these pathways is largely unknown in certain conditions, such as I/R injury. In the development of effective and safe caspase therapeutics, a number of questions need to be addressed: does some level of redundancy occur in cell death pathways so that blocking the apoptotic pathway leads to activation of autophagy or necrosis and do these pathways have common elements?\nAutophagic cell death is characterized by production of vesicles containing cytoplasm and organelles, which are degraded in the lysosome. This type of cell death is induced upon cellular stress such as starvation, accumulation of misfolded proteins and irradiation. The link between apoptosis, caspases and the process of autophagy is still unclear, inhibition of apoptosis and caspases has been reported to induce autophagy suggesting an inhibitory role of caspases in autophagy. Cells deficient in the Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak fail to undergo apoptosis following etoposide treatment, however, autophagy occurs instead [145]. Treatment of mouse L929 fibroblastic cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk directly induces autophagic death, treated cells contained intact mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, however, also contained membrane-bound vesicles. Caspase-8 and a calpain-like cysteine protease are believed to inhibit autophagic cell death in these cells [146,147]. The possibility of inducing autophagic cell death upon caspase inhibition must be considered during the development of beneficial caspase therapeutics.\n\nRole of caspases in non-apoptotic and non-inflammatory processes\nWhile caspases play critical roles in apoptosis and inflammation, it has emerged that some caspases contribute to other important biological processes including differentiation and proliferation. These additional roles are as yet poorly understood but must be considered when assessing the risk of adverse effects following treatment with caspases inhibitors.\n\nRole of caspases in differentiation and cell fusion\nThe epidermis is composed of keratinocytes, which during turnover from basal to upper epidermal layers differentiate into flattened corneocytes lacking nuclei and other organelles. Differentiating keratinocytes share some features with apoptosis such as DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of caspase activity performed with the inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and Boc-D-fmk impairs differentiation through the failure of nuclei to degrade [148]. Caspase-14 has been implicated in the process of keratinocyte differentiation. This caspase is expressed mainly in epidermal cells and expression increases upon differentiation including cleavage of the proenzyme to the active form. Moreover, retinoic acid, a modulator of keratinocyte differentiation, suppressed caspase-14 mRNA in an in vitro model [5][6][7].\nA similar process of denucleation occurs in lens fiber cells. Caspases have been implicated in this process due to the observation of PARP cleavage and inhibition of denucleation performed with the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk in differentiating cells. However, the caspases implicated are unknown, both caspase-3 and -9 are putative mediators of denucleation [149][150][151]. Caspases have also been implicated in the differentiation of erythrocytes and dendritic cells [152][153][154][155].\nCaspases are involved in the process of cell fusion. Caspase-8 has been associated with the syncytical fusion of cytotrophoblasts to form syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta. Antisense oligonucleotides for caspase-8 and the caspase-8 inhibitors IETD-cho and Z-IETD-cho reduces fusion in these cells [156].\nCaspases, in particular caspase-3, are also associated with the formation of myotubes from fusion of myoblasts. The link between caspase-3 and myoblast differentiation may occur via mammalian sterile twenty-like kinase cleavage, which is an effector of myoblast differentiation and a caspase-3 substrate. Deletion of caspase-3 in myoblasts or the inhibition of caspase-3 activity via Z-DEVD-fmk treatment has been shown to reduce myotube formation [157].\n\nRole of caspases in cell proliferation\nCaspases are implicated in T-cell proliferation due to the suppression of growth upon treatment with caspase inhibitors [158,159]. Caspase-8 may be involved in this process as the caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP1 has been shown to modulate T-cell proliferation [160]. Similarly, caspase-8 and -6 act as positive regulators of Bcell proliferation. B-cells deficient in caspase-8 have been shown to fail to proliferate in response to LPS and double-stranded DNA in a mouse model [161]. In a second study, inhibition of caspase-6 and -8 caused suppression of B-cell proliferation. Additionally, inhibition of caspase-6 alone blocked Cyclin D induction and CDK 4 expression levels required for cell cycle progression [162].\nIn contrast, caspase-3 may act as a negative regulator of B-cell proliferation. A study by Woo et al. demonstrated increased B-cell proliferation in caspase-3 null mice compared to wild-type specimens. The cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor, p21, is a substrate for caspase-3 and may mediate the anti-proliferative effects of caspase-3 [163].\n\nThe future of caspase therapeutics\nThe potential to produce therapeutics through the regulation of caspases is evident, to date a number of caspase inhibitors, such as Pralnacasan and IDN6556, have demonstrated beneficial therapeutic effects upon administration. However, there are a number of challenges in the development of safe and effective drugs. One major obstacle is the lack of knowledge regarding the role of caspases in certain apoptosis-associated diseases, and an incomplete understanding of the different cell death pathways that contribute to these diseases. Information regarding the therapeutic window for administration is also required. Administration of caspase therapeutics without this information may have deleterious effects to the patient.\nAnother challenge facing the utilization of caspase therapeutics is the development of adverse effects upon treatment. Off-target effects may occur due to lack of drug specificity leading to the modulation of non-target caspases or indeed unrelated proteins.\nAdditionally, interference with non-apoptotic or non-inflammatory roles of caspases may result in adverse effects and must also be considered. Research relating to the long-term consequences of caspase inhibition, in particular for the treatment of chronic conditions, is required to determine the safety of these drugs and the future of caspase therapeutics.", "prompt": "Caspases as therapeutic targets\n\nAbstract The development of small molecules to modulate caspase activity offers a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of apoptosis-related and inflammatory diseases. Caspases are key mediators of apoptosis and inflammation; deregulation of their activation or expression can lead to the development of conditions such as neurodegenerative and autoinflammatory disorders.

These proteases are executioners of the cell and also have a role in inflammation and differentiation. There are a total of 14 mammalian caspases thus far identified, 12 of which are human (namely caspases 1-10, 12 and 14). The caspases are divided into two groups, dependent on their main function. Members, who act in the process of apoptosis, are one group and include caspases 2, 3 and 6-10. The second group are involved in maturation of cytokines and include caspase-1, -4, -5 and -12 [1,2]. These caspases are present in the cell as inactive zymogens consisting of a prodomain followed by a P20 subunit and P10 subunit, which contain substrate recognition and catalytic domains. Activated caspases cleave a variety of substrates with approximately 400 targets having been identified to date. These include proteins involved in signal transduction (apoptosis regulators, cytokines, serine/threonine kinases), structural proteins (cytoskeletal and nuclear) and proteins involved in regulation of transcription, translation and RNA editing [3,4]. In contrast to the apoptotic and inflammatory caspases, the precise function of caspase-14 remains undefined. However, a role in keratinocyte differentiation has been determined [5][6][7].\n\nActivation of inflammatory caspases\nThe inflammatory caspases (1, 4, 5 and 12) are involved in cytokine maturation and consequently the inflammatory response. Caspase-1 was the first caspase identified and was discovered in 1989 by Black et al. while attempting to determine the protease responsible for the cleavage of interleukin-1\u2424 (IL-1\u2424) [25]. Subsequent research, utilizing caspase-1-deficient animal models, demonstrated the requirement of caspase-1 for IL-1\u2424 maturation [26,27] Caspase-1 is also involved in the cleavage and activation of interleukin-18  and interleukin-33 (IL-33) [28][29][30]. A role of caspase-1 in neuronal apoptosis has been proposed. Caspase-1-deficient mice have demonstrated normal developmental cell death [26,27], however, these models have also shown resistance to cerebral ischaemic injury and also Rip2 and trophic factor withdrawal-mediated neuronal cell death [31][32][33]. Whether caspase-1 has a direct apoptotic role in these models is unclear, further research is required to determine the true function of caspase-1 in neuronal apoptosis. In contrast, caspase-5 is involved only in IL-1\u2424 cleavage [15]. It is believed that caspase-4 and -5 arose from gene duplication due to their sequence homology [1], although the role of caspase-4 in inflammation needs to be elucidated further.\nActivation of inflammatory caspases requires assembly of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex whose main component is the Nalp proteins, part of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family. These proteins contain the nucleotide binding domain NACHT and the leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain of 20-29 residues [34]. There are 14 human Nalp proteins so far, Nalp 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 and 12 have been shown to modulate caspase-1 activation [15,[35][36][37][38][39], the mechanism by which these proteins facilitate this activation is not fully understood. Nalp 1, the first Nalp protein to be discovered, contains a pyrin (PYD) domain, NACHT domain, five LRR domains similar to other Nalp proteins but also contains an F-interacting domain (FIIND) and a CARD at its carboxy terminal [34].\nThe proposed mechanism of caspase-1 activation in the Nalp 1 inflammasome involves the recruitment of an adaptor molecule known as apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (Asc) through the PYD domain of Nalp 1 [16]. Asc then recruits caspase-1 through its CARD domain while Caspase-5 recruitment occurs through the CARD domain of Nalp 1 [15]. The assembled Nalp 1 inflammasome is believed to facilitate the dimerization and activation of caspase-1 and -5 [15]. In contrast, the Nalp 3 inflammasome activates only caspase-1 and contains the adaptor Asc along with cardinal, a second adapter protein [37].\nWhile lipopolysaccharide (LPS), uric acid crystals and ATP are known inducers of caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u2424 processing [46][47][48], to date, only bacterial muramyl dipeptide has been identified as directly inducing inflammasome formation [49]. The mechanism by which these molecules activate the inflammasome is unknown. Evidence suggests the involvement of signal transduction through the LRR domain of Nalps and changes in potassium levels due to cellular stress [49,50]. Recently  Owing to the diverse role of these interleukins in inflammation, modulation of caspase-1 provides an efficient means of controlling interleukin activation and the ensuing onset of the inflammatory response.\n\nModification of caspase activation\nResearch into the utilization of modulators of caspase activation in the treatment of certain conditions offers a novel therapeutic approach. These modulators may indirectly activate or repress caspase activation by targeting the proteins involved in caspase activation such as Apaf-1 of the apoptosome [61,62]. Direct modification of caspase activity is also possible through the use of molecules such as peptides, which bind the active site of caspases.\nCaspase regulation may also occur through binding of molecules to allosteric sites. Inhibition of caspases-1, -3 and -7 has been reported through binding of thiol-containing inhibitors to cysteine residues of allosteric sites. The conformational changes produced by inhibitor binding are similar to those found in the inactive form of these caspases and culminates in the prevention of peptide binding in the active site [63,64]. This review will focus on caspase inhibition via active site binding as the therapeutic potential and clinical effects of caspase inhibitors are based largely on this type of inhibitor.\n\nSynthetic molecules as inhibitors of caspase activity\nInitially, peptide-based small molecular inhibitors of caspases were developed based on the cleavage sites of caspase substrates such as DEVD site of PARP. These molecules took advantage of the requirement of caspases for an aspartic acid at the P1 position of the substrate [2]. Specificity of these caspase inhibitors is influenced by the preference of different caspases for certain amino acids in positions P2 to P5 of the active site.\nPosition P4 is a key determinant for specificity; inflammatory caspases prefer large aromatic or hydrophobic amino acids at this position with the preferred cleavage site sequence of WEHD.\nCaspase-2, -3 and -7 prefer an aspartic acid at P4 whereas caspases-6, -8 and -9 prefer large aliphatic side chains and the sequence (L/V)EXD [2]. Caspase-2 prefers an additional substrate interaction, favouring small hydrophobic residues at position P5 [65]. Specificity data for several caspase inhibitors are illustrated in Table 1. These data demonstrate the preference of caspases for certain amino acids. It must be noted, however, that the specificity of inhibitors may alter within biological systems where cross-reactivity with abundant non-target caspases may occur [66].\nInitial modifications to peptide-based inhibitors involved the addition of electrophilic groups on the P1 aspartic acid residue such as aldehydes, nitriles or ketones to produce reversible inhibitors. These inhibitors have demonstrated low potency in cell-based systems possibly due to inability to reach necessary concentrations to inhibit sufficient caspase activation [67,68]. In\n\nIC50 value Caspase 1 Caspase 4 Caspase 5 Caspase 3 Caspase 7 Caspase 6 Caspase 2 Caspase 8 Caspase 9 Caspase 10\nReference contrast, the addition of chloro, fluoro-, acyloxy, or diazomethyl ketones produces more potent irreversible inhibitors [69]. Several adaptations have been made to these reversible and irreversible inhibitors to improve cell penetration and stability allowing for the development of effective therapeutics. A number of P2 and P3 replacements have been developed; mainly pyridone, pyrimidone and pyridazinodiazepine scaffolds [70,71]. Non-peptide caspase inhibitors are also currently in development. So far, non-peptide molecules that have been described include isatin sulfonamides and onilinoquinazolines [72,73]. At\n\nRole of caspases in disease\nCaspases are key mediators of apoptosis and inflammation, the loss or gain of caspase activity/expression is the basis of a number of diseases caused by deregulation of the apoptotic and inflammatory pathways. While important diseases are associated with a lack of caspase activity (e.g. cancer where apoptosis is typically decreased), this review will focus on those diseases and conditions associated with increased caspase activity, as it is in these cases that the role of caspases as therapeutic targets is most clear. The role of caspases in neurodegenerative diseases is still unclear; identification of caspase activity in these diseases is not evidence of a causal role of caspases or the implication of a beneficial effect upon caspase inhibition. Research into disease progression performed with animal models offers an insight into these conditions, however animal models must be chosen carefully. For example, the use of certain neurotoxins that mimic PD may not give a true representation of the disease pathology in human beings. The use of caspase inhibitors as therapeutic agents will prove difficult until the mechanisms behind disease progression are elucidated.\n\nIschaemia\nIschaemia is the restriction of blood supply to tissue, the subsequent return of blood flow is known as reperfusion. Ischaemia leads to increased pH, ATP depletion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which initiate signalling cascades leading to cell death and inflammation. Ischaemia-induced cell death may occur by apoptosis, necrosis or autophagy [98], and the factors that determine the extent to which each of these pathways contribute to cell death during ischaemia is largely unknown.\n\nIschaemia/reperfusion injuryimplications in transplant injury\nA major obstacle of organ transplantation is ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which occurs in the course of organ preservation and subsequent transplant to the recipient. The use of caspase inhibitors may offer a therapeutic strategy to reduce transplant injury and failure as an increase in apoptotic cells and caspase activity has been reported in transplanted organs including the heart, kidneys, liver, lungs and pancreas [109][110][111][112][113].\nThe irreversible pan-caspase inhibitor IDN6556 has been tested in a rat model of lung transplantation [114]. The beneficial effects of IDN6556 on transplanted lung function was dependant on length of cold ischaemia storage with a significant increase in lung function when grafts were stored for 18 hrs, transplanted and reperfused for 2 hrs.\nIDN6556 is currently in clinical trials for use during liver transplantation. A Phase II trial demonstrated that addition of this caspase inhibitor to organ preservation solution significantly reduced apoptosis and caspase-3 and -7 activity after reperfusion. However, additional administration of this inhibitor to the recipient abrogated this reduction leading to apoptotic levels similar to placebo, together with increased levels of neutrophil infiltration in the liver. IDN6556 administration did not reduce the rate of acute cellular rejection in this trial [75].\nThe use of caspase inhibitors to reduce I/R injury in transplant organ does show promise due to the short-term nature of treatment. Addition of caspase inhibitors to organ preservation solution also allows for selective treatment of target cells. Further research is required to determine the contribution of apoptotic cell death in I/R transplant injury in order to establish the therapeutic benefits of caspase inhibition.\nIDN6556 has also been utilized in the treatment of liver disease such as hepatitis. Clinical trials performed with IDN6556 have demonstrated a reduction in transaminase levels, which are markers for hepatic injury. However, transaminase levels returned to pre-treatment levels following discontinuation of IDN6556 treatment [76,115] suggesting chronic drug treatment may be required. This could be problematic due to the increased risk of adverse side effects that accompany long-term treatment.\n\nDeregulation of the inflammatory response can lead to the development of autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Caspases activate a number of key cytokines required for the inflammatory response. Therefore, caspases represent a target for drugs to prevent induction of this response in inflammatory diseases.\nMutations that lead to defects in the components of the inflammasome effect caspase-1 activation and therefore affect the inflammatory response by altering interleukin activation. [116,117] [116,118]. Caspase-1 inhibition may also be beneficial in the treatment of the auto-inflammatory disorder, familial Mediterranean fever which is associated with mutations of the pyrin protein [119,120]. Mutations in this protein can lead to induction of Asc oligomerization and inflammasome assembly in vitro [121]. Pyrin may also bind to caspase-1 directly [122].\n\n. The reasons for this increase in activity in response to NACHT domain mutations of nalp 3 are unknown. In principle, mutations may enhance inflammasome assembly as the NACHT domain is involved in oligomerization or mutations may reduce the binding of inhibitory proteins to Nalp 3 [37]. The caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 may have the potential to be used in the treatment of familial cold urticaria and other autoinflammatory diseases. The treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and whole blood from familial cold urticaria patients with VX-765 suppresses LPS-induced IL-1\u2424 activation\nAutoimmune disorders occur due to deregulation of the inflammatory response causing self-directed inflammation mediated through the adaptive immune response. Disorders include rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Regulation of interleukins through modulation of caspase activity may provide a method to control these disorders. The caspase- 1\n\ninhibitor Pralnacasan has been utilized in the treatment of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. DSS-induced colitis is a model for human inflammatory bowel disease. Combined treatment with DSS and Pralnacasan showed reduction in inflammatory cells, IL-18 levels in colons and INF-\u2425 in para-aortal lymph nodes compared with the DSS/placebo group [123]. In a separate study, cytokine expression was investigated in DSS-treated mice. DSS treatment led to an increase in IL-18, TNF-\u2423, IL-12 and INF-\u2425 protein levels with Pralnacasan suppressing the increase of IL-18, IL-1\u2424, TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) [124].\nPralnacasan is a peptidomimetic compound containing a pyridazinodiazepine scaffold at the P2-P3 site, which selectively inhibits caspase-1, demonstrating IC50 values of 1.3 nM, 2.3 M and 0.12 M for caspase-1, -3 and -8, respectively [74]. Upon administration, the ethoxyl group of the compound is hydrolyzed producing the active compound RU36384/VRT-018858 [125]. [126].\n\nPralnacasan inhibits LPS-induced IL-1\u2424 release and S. aureus cowan-induced IL-1\u2424 and IL-18 release in human PBMC. In a mouse model, Pralnacasan also suppresses IL-1\u2424 release induced by LPS injection\nIn 2001, data on the effect of Pralnacasan in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were published. Oral administration of Pralnacasan in DBA/1 mice with established collagen-induced arthritis reduced paw inflammation and disease progression. A reduction in cartilage damage and bone erosion in Pralnacasan treated mice compared to vehicle treated mice was also reported.\nThe use of Pralnacasan was also extended to osteoarthritis (OA). Treatment in two murine models of knee OA showed lower histopathological scores and a reduction in hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) /lysylpyridinoline (LP) ratio of collagen cross-links in the urine indicating a reduction in cartilage degradation. In this study, OA was induced in Balb/c mice by injection of bacterial collagenases, STR/1N mice were also utilized due to their ability to develop OA spontaneously [125]. Clinical  The use of caspase-1 inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory diseases has proved successful in a number of trials. However, adverse side effects, such as liver fibrosis, associated with caspase modulation pose a major obstacle in the development of caspase therapeutics and will be discussed in more detail in later sections. [127]. [128]. The mechanisms by which caspases contribute to sepsis include the release of cytokines and induction of apoptosis, the degree to which these processes contribute to sepsis is largely unknown.\n\nRole of caspase-1 and -12 in sepsis\nThe mechanism by which caspase-1 mediates its response in sepsis is not fully understood but is believed to involve the activation of interleukins through the inflammasome. IL-18 activation stimulates the inflammatory response by INF-\u2425 production and T-cell polarization and may act as a predictive factor for lethal sepsis [129]. Additionally, caspase-1 activation of IL-1\u2424 leads to the upregulation of pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor in neutrophils inhibiting apoptosis of these cells [130,131]. Delayed neutrophil apoptosis has been reported to occur during sepsis [132,133]. Neutrophil numbers are usually tightly regulated in vivo by the induction of apoptosis approximately 5 hrs after maturation [134], delayed apoptosis leads to an increase in neutrophil numbers contributing to hyperresponsive immunity and the symptoms of SIRS. A role of caspase-1 independent of cytokines Il-1\u2424 and IL-18 in sepsis has also been proposed following a study utilizing a murine model of sepsis. Caspase-1 knockout mice but not IL-1\u2424/IL-18 double knockout mice demonstrated increased survival and protection from splenic B lymphocyte apoptosis [135].\nThe full-length version of inflammatory caspase-12 (casp12-L) is implicated in sepsis. Casp-12-L confers hyporesponsiveness to LPS as measured by cytokine release and is associated with increased mortality rates in patients with severe sepsis [53]. This\n\nRole of apoptotic caspases in sepsis\nThe apoptotic caspases also play a part in the development of sepsis. Increased lymphocyte apoptosis may occur in sepsis contributing to the symptoms of CARS. Reduced levels of B-, CD4 T-and dendritic cells have been reported in septic patients and also in animal models of sepsis [133,136,137]. Caspase-2, -3, -6 and -9 have been implicated in lymphocyte apoptosis [138] and prevention of lymphocyte apoptosis by caspase inhibitors improves survival in sepsis models [137,139]. Lymphocyte apoptosis not only contribute to CARS by reducing the number of Band T-cells, but also the uptake of apoptotic cells can lead to macrophage and dendritic cell non-responsiveness known as anergy [140].\nThe utilization of caspase therapeutics may prove problematic in the case of sepsis due to lack of knowledge regarding the complex nature of sepsis development and progression and also the diverse roles that caspases may perform in this condition.\n\nChallenges facing the development of caspase therapeutics\nIn the development of a safe and effective caspase therapeutics, a number of criteria, such as drug specificity and selectivity, must be considered. This section highlights some of the key questions, which must be addressed in the development of caspase therapeutics.\nFirstly, an understanding of the contribution of apoptosis to cell death in the condition to be treated is essential, along with knowledge of the caspases implicated and the therapeutic window for treatment. As described in previous sections, apoptosis may not account for all cell death occurring in a certain condition. In ischaemia/reperfusion injury, three types of cell death may take place, namely apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis. Use of caspase inhibitors may only partially block cell death in this situation [141].\nTrials designed to determine the effectiveness and potency of caspase therapeutics in the prevention of apoptosis must consider appropriate techniques to detect apoptosis. The hallmarks of apoptosis include chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing and cleavage of a variety of caspase substrates. A study by Methot et al. reported a 3.5-fold increase in caspase inhibitor concentration required to inhibit DNA fragmentation by 95% compared to the concentration required to reduce \u2423 II spectrin cleavage by 95% in primary thymocytes [142]. This study illustrates the importance of accurate determination of apoptosis in the evaluation of caspase inhibitors.\nFollowing on from this, detection of apoptosis performed with these parameters does not give an indication of cell death occurring through apoptosis independent pathways, leading to the question: will inhibition of caspase activation protect cells from death? Evidence that cells are not protected includes the study of OCI-AML3 cells treated with a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs, which lead to activation of caspase-2, -3, -7, -8 and -9, and also PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. The caspase inhibitors IDN-1529 and IDN-1965 blocked apoptosis as determined by the above parameters. Cell death, however, was not prevented in these cells as determined by cell number, release of Cytochrome c, Smac and Omi from the mitochondria and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) [143]. In a second study, Bax-induced death in Jurkat cells demonstrated the features of apoptosis; however, caspase inhibition performed with Z-VAD-fmk in these cells led to cell death induced by loss of MMP [144].\n\nRole of caspases in other aspects of cell death\nThere are a number of different cell death pathways including autophagy, necrosis and mitotic catastrophe. The type of cell death chosen as well as the degree of overlap between these pathways is largely unknown in certain conditions, such as I/R injury. In the development of effective and safe caspase therapeutics, a number of questions need to be addressed: does some level of redundancy occur in cell death pathways so that blocking the apoptotic pathway leads to activation of autophagy or necrosis and do these pathways have common elements?\nAutophagic cell death is characterized by production of vesicles containing cytoplasm and organelles, which are degraded in the lysosome. This type of cell death is induced upon cellular stress such as starvation, accumulation of misfolded proteins and irradiation. The link between apoptosis, caspases and the process of autophagy is still unclear, inhibition of apoptosis and caspases has been reported to induce autophagy suggesting an inhibitory role of caspases in autophagy. Cells deficient in the Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak fail to undergo apoptosis following etoposide treatment, however, autophagy occurs instead [145]. Treatment of mouse L929 fibroblastic cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk directly induces autophagic death, treated cells contained intact mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, however, also contained membrane-bound vesicles. Caspase-8 and a calpain-like cysteine protease are believed to inhibit autophagic cell death in these cells [146,147]. The possibility of inducing autophagic cell death upon caspase inhibition must be considered during the development of beneficial caspase therapeutics.\n\nRole of caspases in non-apoptotic and non-inflammatory processes\nWhile caspases play critical roles in apoptosis and inflammation, it has emerged that some caspases contribute to other important biological processes including differentiation and proliferation. These additional roles are as yet poorly understood but must be considered when assessing the risk of adverse effects following treatment with caspases inhibitors.\n\nRole of caspases in differentiation and cell fusion\nThe epidermis is composed of keratinocytes, which during turnover from basal to upper epidermal layers differentiate into flattened corneocytes lacking nuclei and other organelles. Differentiating keratinocytes share some features with apoptosis such as DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of caspase activity performed with the inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and Boc-D-fmk impairs differentiation through the failure of nuclei to degrade [148]. Caspase-14 has been implicated in the process of keratinocyte differentiation. This caspase is expressed mainly in epidermal cells and expression increases upon differentiation including cleavage of the proenzyme to the active form. Moreover, retinoic acid, a modulator of keratinocyte differentiation, suppressed caspase-14 mRNA in an in vitro model [5][6][7].\nA similar process of denucleation occurs in lens fiber cells. Caspases have been implicated in this process due to the observation of PARP cleavage and inhibition of denucleation performed with the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk in differentiating cells. However, the caspases implicated are unknown, both caspase-3 and -9 are putative mediators of denucleation [149][150][151]. Caspases have also been implicated in the differentiation of erythrocytes and dendritic cells [152][153][154][155].\nCaspases are involved in the process of cell fusion. Caspase-8 has been associated with the syncytical fusion of cytotrophoblasts to form syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta. Antisense oligonucleotides for caspase-8 and the caspase-8 inhibitors IETD-cho and Z-IETD-cho reduces fusion in these cells [156].\nCaspases, in particular caspase-3, are also associated with the formation of myotubes from fusion of myoblasts. The link between caspase-3 and myoblast differentiation may occur via mammalian sterile twenty-like kinase cleavage, which is an effector of myoblast differentiation and a caspase-3 substrate. Deletion of caspase-3 in myoblasts or the inhibition of caspase-3 activity via Z-DEVD-fmk treatment has been shown to reduce myotube formation [157].\n\nRole of caspases in cell proliferation\nCaspases are implicated in T-cell proliferation due to the suppression of growth upon treatment with caspase inhibitors [158,159]. Caspase-8 may be involved in this process as the caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP1 has been shown to modulate T-cell proliferation [160]. Similarly, caspase-8 and -6 act as positive regulators of Bcell proliferation. B-cells deficient in caspase-8 have been shown to fail to proliferate in response to LPS and double-stranded DNA in a mouse model [161]. In a second study, inhibition of caspase-6 and -8 caused suppression of B-cell proliferation. Additionally, inhibition of caspase-6 alone blocked Cyclin D induction and CDK 4 expression levels required for cell cycle progression [162].\nIn contrast, caspase-3 may act as a negative regulator of B-cell proliferation. A study by Woo et al. demonstrated increased B-cell proliferation in caspase-3 null mice compared to wild-type specimens. The cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor, p21, is a substrate for caspase-3 and may mediate the anti-proliferative effects of caspase-3 [163].\n\nThe future of caspase therapeutics\nThe potential to produce therapeutics through the regulation of caspases is evident, to date a number of caspase inhibitors, such as Pralnacasan and IDN6556, have demonstrated beneficial therapeutic effects upon administration. However, there are a number of challenges in the development of safe and effective drugs. One major obstacle is the lack of knowledge regarding the role of caspases in certain apoptosis-associated diseases, and an incomplete understanding of the different cell death pathways that contribute to these diseases. Information regarding the therapeutic window for administration is also required. Administration of caspase therapeutics without this information may have deleterious effects to the patient.\nAnother challenge facing the utilization of caspase therapeutics is the development of adverse effects upon treatment. Off-target effects may occur due to lack of drug specificity leading to the modulation of non-target caspases or indeed unrelated proteins.\nAdditionally, interference with non-apoptotic or non-inflammatory roles of caspases may result in adverse effects and must also be considered. Research relating to the long-term consequences of caspase inhibition, in particular for the treatment of chronic conditions, is required to determine the safety of these drugs and the future of caspase therapeutics.\nWrite a numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing:1.

These proteases are executioners of the cell and also have a role in inflammation and differentiation. There are a total of 14 mammalian caspases thus far identified, 12 of which are human (namely caspases 1-10, 12 and 14). The caspases are divided into two groups, dependent on their main function. Members, who act in the process of apoptosis, are one group and include caspases 2, 3 and 6-10. The second group are involved in maturation of cytokines and include caspase-1, -4, -5 and -12 [1,2]. These caspases are present in the cell as inactive zymogens consisting of a prodomain followed by a P20 subunit and P10 subunit, which contain substrate recognition and catalytic domains. Activated caspases cleave a variety of substrates with approximately 400 targets having been identified to date. These include proteins involved in signal transduction (apoptosis regulators, cytokines, serine/threonine kinases), structural proteins (cytoskeletal and nuclear) and proteins involved in regulation of transcription, translation and RNA editing [3,4]. In contrast to the apoptotic and inflammatory caspases, the precise function of caspase-14 remains undefined. However, a role in keratinocyte differentiation has been determined [5][6][7].\n\nActivation of inflammatory caspases\nThe inflammatory caspases (1, 4, 5 and 12) are involved in cytokine maturation and consequently the inflammatory response. Caspase-1 was the first caspase identified and was discovered in 1989 by Black et al. while attempting to determine the protease responsible for the cleavage of interleukin-1\u2424 (IL-1\u2424) [25]. Subsequent research, utilizing caspase-1-deficient animal models, demonstrated the requirement of caspase-1 for IL-1\u2424 maturation [26,27] Caspase-1 is also involved in the cleavage and activation of interleukin-18  and interleukin-33 (IL-33) [28][29][30]. A role of caspase-1 in neuronal apoptosis has been proposed. Caspase-1-deficient mice have demonstrated normal developmental cell death [26,27], however, these models have also shown resistance to cerebral ischaemic injury and also Rip2 and trophic factor withdrawal-mediated neuronal cell death [31][32][33]. Whether caspase-1 has a direct apoptotic role in these models is unclear, further research is required to determine the true function of caspase-1 in neuronal apoptosis. In contrast, caspase-5 is involved only in IL-1\u2424 cleavage [15]. It is believed that caspase-4 and -5 arose from gene duplication due to their sequence homology [1], although the role of caspase-4 in inflammation needs to be elucidated further.\nActivation of inflammatory caspases requires assembly of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex whose main component is the Nalp proteins, part of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family. These proteins contain the nucleotide binding domain NACHT and the leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain of 20-29 residues [34]. There are 14 human Nalp proteins so far, Nalp 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 and 12 have been shown to modulate caspase-1 activation [15,[35][36][37][38][39], the mechanism by which these proteins facilitate this activation is not fully understood. Nalp 1, the first Nalp protein to be discovered, contains a pyrin (PYD) domain, NACHT domain, five LRR domains similar to other Nalp proteins but also contains an F-interacting domain (FIIND) and a CARD at its carboxy terminal [34].\nThe proposed mechanism of caspase-1 activation in the Nalp 1 inflammasome involves the recruitment of an adaptor molecule known as apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (Asc) through the PYD domain of Nalp 1 [16]. Asc then recruits caspase-1 through its CARD domain while Caspase-5 recruitment occurs through the CARD domain of Nalp 1 [15]. The assembled Nalp 1 inflammasome is believed to facilitate the dimerization and activation of caspase-1 and -5 [15]. In contrast, the Nalp 3 inflammasome activates only caspase-1 and contains the adaptor Asc along with cardinal, a second adapter protein [37].\nWhile lipopolysaccharide (LPS), uric acid crystals and ATP are known inducers of caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u2424 processing [46][47][48], to date, only bacterial muramyl dipeptide has been identified as directly inducing inflammasome formation [49]. The mechanism by which these molecules activate the inflammasome is unknown. Evidence suggests the involvement of signal transduction through the LRR domain of Nalps and changes in potassium levels due to cellular stress [49,50]. Recently  Owing to the diverse role of these interleukins in inflammation, modulation of caspase-1 provides an efficient means of controlling interleukin activation and the ensuing onset of the inflammatory response.\n\nModification of caspase activation\nResearch into the utilization of modulators of caspase activation in the treatment of certain conditions offers a novel therapeutic approach. These modulators may indirectly activate or repress caspase activation by targeting the proteins involved in caspase activation such as Apaf-1 of the apoptosome [61,62]. Direct modification of caspase activity is also possible through the use of molecules such as peptides, which bind the active site of caspases.\nCaspase regulation may also occur through binding of molecules to allosteric sites. Inhibition of caspases-1, -3 and -7 has been reported through binding of thiol-containing inhibitors to cysteine residues of allosteric sites. The conformational changes produced by inhibitor binding are similar to those found in the inactive form of these caspases and culminates in the prevention of peptide binding in the active site [63,64]. This review will focus on caspase inhibition via active site binding as the therapeutic potential and clinical effects of caspase inhibitors are based largely on this type of inhibitor.\n\nSynthetic molecules as inhibitors of caspase activity\nInitially, peptide-based small molecular inhibitors of caspases were developed based on the cleavage sites of caspase substrates such as DEVD site of PARP. These molecules took advantage of the requirement of caspases for an aspartic acid at the P1 position of the substrate [2]. Specificity of these caspase inhibitors is influenced by the preference of different caspases for certain amino acids in positions P2 to P5 of the active site.\nPosition P4 is a key determinant for specificity; inflammatory caspases prefer large aromatic or hydrophobic amino acids at this position with the preferred cleavage site sequence of WEHD.\nCaspase-2, -3 and -7 prefer an aspartic acid at P4 whereas caspases-6, -8 and -9 prefer large aliphatic side chains and the sequence (L/V)EXD [2]. Caspase-2 prefers an additional substrate interaction, favouring small hydrophobic residues at position P5 [65]. Specificity data for several caspase inhibitors are illustrated in Table 1. These data demonstrate the preference of caspases for certain amino acids. It must be noted, however, that the specificity of inhibitors may alter within biological systems where cross-reactivity with abundant non-target caspases may occur [66].\nInitial modifications to peptide-based inhibitors involved the addition of electrophilic groups on the P1 aspartic acid residue such as aldehydes, nitriles or ketones to produce reversible inhibitors. These inhibitors have demonstrated low potency in cell-based systems possibly due to inability to reach necessary concentrations to inhibit sufficient caspase activation [67,68]. In\n\nIC50 value Caspase 1 Caspase 4 Caspase 5 Caspase 3 Caspase 7 Caspase 6 Caspase 2 Caspase 8 Caspase 9 Caspase 10\nReference contrast, the addition of chloro, fluoro-, acyloxy, or diazomethyl ketones produces more potent irreversible inhibitors [69]. Several adaptations have been made to these reversible and irreversible inhibitors to improve cell penetration and stability allowing for the development of effective therapeutics. A number of P2 and P3 replacements have been developed; mainly pyridone, pyrimidone and pyridazinodiazepine scaffolds [70,71]. Non-peptide caspase inhibitors are also currently in development. So far, non-peptide molecules that have been described include isatin sulfonamides and onilinoquinazolines [72,73]. At\n\nRole of caspases in disease\nCaspases are key mediators of apoptosis and inflammation, the loss or gain of caspase activity/expression is the basis of a number of diseases caused by deregulation of the apoptotic and inflammatory pathways. While important diseases are associated with a lack of caspase activity (e.g. cancer where apoptosis is typically decreased), this review will focus on those diseases and conditions associated with increased caspase activity, as it is in these cases that the role of caspases as therapeutic targets is most clear. The role of caspases in neurodegenerative diseases is still unclear; identification of caspase activity in these diseases is not evidence of a causal role of caspases or the implication of a beneficial effect upon caspase inhibition. Research into disease progression performed with animal models offers an insight into these conditions, however animal models must be chosen carefully. For example, the use of certain neurotoxins that mimic PD may not give a true representation of the disease pathology in human beings. The use of caspase inhibitors as therapeutic agents will prove difficult until the mechanisms behind disease progression are elucidated.\n\nIschaemia\nIschaemia is the restriction of blood supply to tissue, the subsequent return of blood flow is known as reperfusion. Ischaemia leads to increased pH, ATP depletion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which initiate signalling cascades leading to cell death and inflammation. Ischaemia-induced cell death may occur by apoptosis, necrosis or autophagy [98], and the factors that determine the extent to which each of these pathways contribute to cell death during ischaemia is largely unknown.\n\nIschaemia/reperfusion injuryimplications in transplant injury\nA major obstacle of organ transplantation is ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which occurs in the course of organ preservation and subsequent transplant to the recipient. The use of caspase inhibitors may offer a therapeutic strategy to reduce transplant injury and failure as an increase in apoptotic cells and caspase activity has been reported in transplanted organs including the heart, kidneys, liver, lungs and pancreas [109][110][111][112][113].\nThe irreversible pan-caspase inhibitor IDN6556 has been tested in a rat model of lung transplantation [114]. The beneficial effects of IDN6556 on transplanted lung function was dependant on length of cold ischaemia storage with a significant increase in lung function when grafts were stored for 18 hrs, transplanted and reperfused for 2 hrs.\nIDN6556 is currently in clinical trials for use during liver transplantation. A Phase II trial demonstrated that addition of this caspase inhibitor to organ preservation solution significantly reduced apoptosis and caspase-3 and -7 activity after reperfusion. However, additional administration of this inhibitor to the recipient abrogated this reduction leading to apoptotic levels similar to placebo, together with increased levels of neutrophil infiltration in the liver. IDN6556 administration did not reduce the rate of acute cellular rejection in this trial [75].\nThe use of caspase inhibitors to reduce I/R injury in transplant organ does show promise due to the short-term nature of treatment. Addition of caspase inhibitors to organ preservation solution also allows for selective treatment of target cells. Further research is required to determine the contribution of apoptotic cell death in I/R transplant injury in order to establish the therapeutic benefits of caspase inhibition.\nIDN6556 has also been utilized in the treatment of liver disease such as hepatitis. Clinical trials performed with IDN6556 have demonstrated a reduction in transaminase levels, which are markers for hepatic injury. However, transaminase levels returned to pre-treatment levels following discontinuation of IDN6556 treatment [76,115] suggesting chronic drug treatment may be required. This could be problematic due to the increased risk of adverse side effects that accompany long-term treatment.\n\nDeregulation of the inflammatory response can lead to the development of autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Caspases activate a number of key cytokines required for the inflammatory response. Therefore, caspases represent a target for drugs to prevent induction of this response in inflammatory diseases.\nMutations that lead to defects in the components of the inflammasome effect caspase-1 activation and therefore affect the inflammatory response by altering interleukin activation. [116,117] [116,118]. Caspase-1 inhibition may also be beneficial in the treatment of the auto-inflammatory disorder, familial Mediterranean fever which is associated with mutations of the pyrin protein [119,120]. Mutations in this protein can lead to induction of Asc oligomerization and inflammasome assembly in vitro [121]. Pyrin may also bind to caspase-1 directly [122].\n\n. The reasons for this increase in activity in response to NACHT domain mutations of nalp 3 are unknown. In principle, mutations may enhance inflammasome assembly as the NACHT domain is involved in oligomerization or mutations may reduce the binding of inhibitory proteins to Nalp 3 [37]. The caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 may have the potential to be used in the treatment of familial cold urticaria and other autoinflammatory diseases. The treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and whole blood from familial cold urticaria patients with VX-765 suppresses LPS-induced IL-1\u2424 activation\nAutoimmune disorders occur due to deregulation of the inflammatory response causing self-directed inflammation mediated through the adaptive immune response. Disorders include rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Regulation of interleukins through modulation of caspase activity may provide a method to control these disorders. The caspase- 1\n\ninhibitor Pralnacasan has been utilized in the treatment of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. DSS-induced colitis is a model for human inflammatory bowel disease. Combined treatment with DSS and Pralnacasan showed reduction in inflammatory cells, IL-18 levels in colons and INF-\u2425 in para-aortal lymph nodes compared with the DSS/placebo group [123]. In a separate study, cytokine expression was investigated in DSS-treated mice. DSS treatment led to an increase in IL-18, TNF-\u2423, IL-12 and INF-\u2425 protein levels with Pralnacasan suppressing the increase of IL-18, IL-1\u2424, TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) [124].\nPralnacasan is a peptidomimetic compound containing a pyridazinodiazepine scaffold at the P2-P3 site, which selectively inhibits caspase-1, demonstrating IC50 values of 1.3 nM, 2.3 M and 0.12 M for caspase-1, -3 and -8, respectively [74]. Upon administration, the ethoxyl group of the compound is hydrolyzed producing the active compound RU36384/VRT-018858 [125]. [126].\n\nPralnacasan inhibits LPS-induced IL-1\u2424 release and S. aureus cowan-induced IL-1\u2424 and IL-18 release in human PBMC. In a mouse model, Pralnacasan also suppresses IL-1\u2424 release induced by LPS injection\nIn 2001, data on the effect of Pralnacasan in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were published. Oral administration of Pralnacasan in DBA/1 mice with established collagen-induced arthritis reduced paw inflammation and disease progression. A reduction in cartilage damage and bone erosion in Pralnacasan treated mice compared to vehicle treated mice was also reported.\nThe use of Pralnacasan was also extended to osteoarthritis (OA). Treatment in two murine models of knee OA showed lower histopathological scores and a reduction in hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) /lysylpyridinoline (LP) ratio of collagen cross-links in the urine indicating a reduction in cartilage degradation. In this study, OA was induced in Balb/c mice by injection of bacterial collagenases, STR/1N mice were also utilized due to their ability to develop OA spontaneously [125]. Clinical  The use of caspase-1 inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory diseases has proved successful in a number of trials. However, adverse side effects, such as liver fibrosis, associated with caspase modulation pose a major obstacle in the development of caspase therapeutics and will be discussed in more detail in later sections. [127]. [128]. The mechanisms by which caspases contribute to sepsis include the release of cytokines and induction of apoptosis, the degree to which these processes contribute to sepsis is largely unknown.\n\nRole of caspase-1 and -12 in sepsis\nThe mechanism by which caspase-1 mediates its response in sepsis is not fully understood but is believed to involve the activation of interleukins through the inflammasome. IL-18 activation stimulates the inflammatory response by INF-\u2425 production and T-cell polarization and may act as a predictive factor for lethal sepsis [129]. Additionally, caspase-1 activation of IL-1\u2424 leads to the upregulation of pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor in neutrophils inhibiting apoptosis of these cells [130,131]. Delayed neutrophil apoptosis has been reported to occur during sepsis [132,133]. Neutrophil numbers are usually tightly regulated in vivo by the induction of apoptosis approximately 5 hrs after maturation [134], delayed apoptosis leads to an increase in neutrophil numbers contributing to hyperresponsive immunity and the symptoms of SIRS. A role of caspase-1 independent of cytokines Il-1\u2424 and IL-18 in sepsis has also been proposed following a study utilizing a murine model of sepsis. Caspase-1 knockout mice but not IL-1\u2424/IL-18 double knockout mice demonstrated increased survival and protection from splenic B lymphocyte apoptosis [135].\nThe full-length version of inflammatory caspase-12 (casp12-L) is implicated in sepsis. Casp-12-L confers hyporesponsiveness to LPS as measured by cytokine release and is associated with increased mortality rates in patients with severe sepsis [53]. This\n\nRole of apoptotic caspases in sepsis\nThe apoptotic caspases also play a part in the development of sepsis. Increased lymphocyte apoptosis may occur in sepsis contributing to the symptoms of CARS. Reduced levels of B-, CD4 T-and dendritic cells have been reported in septic patients and also in animal models of sepsis [133,136,137]. Caspase-2, -3, -6 and -9 have been implicated in lymphocyte apoptosis [138] and prevention of lymphocyte apoptosis by caspase inhibitors improves survival in sepsis models [137,139]. Lymphocyte apoptosis not only contribute to CARS by reducing the number of Band T-cells, but also the uptake of apoptotic cells can lead to macrophage and dendritic cell non-responsiveness known as anergy [140].\nThe utilization of caspase therapeutics may prove problematic in the case of sepsis due to lack of knowledge regarding the complex nature of sepsis development and progression and also the diverse roles that caspases may perform in this condition.\n\nChallenges facing the development of caspase therapeutics\nIn the development of a safe and effective caspase therapeutics, a number of criteria, such as drug specificity and selectivity, must be considered. This section highlights some of the key questions, which must be addressed in the development of caspase therapeutics.\nFirstly, an understanding of the contribution of apoptosis to cell death in the condition to be treated is essential, along with knowledge of the caspases implicated and the therapeutic window for treatment. As described in previous sections, apoptosis may not account for all cell death occurring in a certain condition. In ischaemia/reperfusion injury, three types of cell death may take place, namely apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis. Use of caspase inhibitors may only partially block cell death in this situation [141].\nTrials designed to determine the effectiveness and potency of caspase therapeutics in the prevention of apoptosis must consider appropriate techniques to detect apoptosis. The hallmarks of apoptosis include chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing and cleavage of a variety of caspase substrates. A study by Methot et al. reported a 3.5-fold increase in caspase inhibitor concentration required to inhibit DNA fragmentation by 95% compared to the concentration required to reduce \u2423 II spectrin cleavage by 95% in primary thymocytes [142]. This study illustrates the importance of accurate determination of apoptosis in the evaluation of caspase inhibitors.\nFollowing on from this, detection of apoptosis performed with these parameters does not give an indication of cell death occurring through apoptosis independent pathways, leading to the question: will inhibition of caspase activation protect cells from death? Evidence that cells are not protected includes the study of OCI-AML3 cells treated with a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs, which lead to activation of caspase-2, -3, -7, -8 and -9, and also PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. The caspase inhibitors IDN-1529 and IDN-1965 blocked apoptosis as determined by the above parameters. Cell death, however, was not prevented in these cells as determined by cell number, release of Cytochrome c, Smac and Omi from the mitochondria and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) [143]. In a second study, Bax-induced death in Jurkat cells demonstrated the features of apoptosis; however, caspase inhibition performed with Z-VAD-fmk in these cells led to cell death induced by loss of MMP [144].\n\nRole of caspases in other aspects of cell death\nThere are a number of different cell death pathways including autophagy, necrosis and mitotic catastrophe. The type of cell death chosen as well as the degree of overlap between these pathways is largely unknown in certain conditions, such as I/R injury. In the development of effective and safe caspase therapeutics, a number of questions need to be addressed: does some level of redundancy occur in cell death pathways so that blocking the apoptotic pathway leads to activation of autophagy or necrosis and do these pathways have common elements?\nAutophagic cell death is characterized by production of vesicles containing cytoplasm and organelles, which are degraded in the lysosome. This type of cell death is induced upon cellular stress such as starvation, accumulation of misfolded proteins and irradiation. The link between apoptosis, caspases and the process of autophagy is still unclear, inhibition of apoptosis and caspases has been reported to induce autophagy suggesting an inhibitory role of caspases in autophagy. Cells deficient in the Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak fail to undergo apoptosis following etoposide treatment, however, autophagy occurs instead [145]. Treatment of mouse L929 fibroblastic cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk directly induces autophagic death, treated cells contained intact mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, however, also contained membrane-bound vesicles. Caspase-8 and a calpain-like cysteine protease are believed to inhibit autophagic cell death in these cells [146,147]. The possibility of inducing autophagic cell death upon caspase inhibition must be considered during the development of beneficial caspase therapeutics.\n\nRole of caspases in non-apoptotic and non-inflammatory processes\nWhile caspases play critical roles in apoptosis and inflammation, it has emerged that some caspases contribute to other important biological processes including differentiation and proliferation. These additional roles are as yet poorly understood but must be considered when assessing the risk of adverse effects following treatment with caspases inhibitors.\n\nRole of caspases in differentiation and cell fusion\nThe epidermis is composed of keratinocytes, which during turnover from basal to upper epidermal layers differentiate into flattened corneocytes lacking nuclei and other organelles. Differentiating keratinocytes share some features with apoptosis such as DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of caspase activity performed with the inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and Boc-D-fmk impairs differentiation through the failure of nuclei to degrade [148]. Caspase-14 has been implicated in the process of keratinocyte differentiation. This caspase is expressed mainly in epidermal cells and expression increases upon differentiation including cleavage of the proenzyme to the active form. Moreover, retinoic acid, a modulator of keratinocyte differentiation, suppressed caspase-14 mRNA in an in vitro model [5][6][7].\nA similar process of denucleation occurs in lens fiber cells. Caspases have been implicated in this process due to the observation of PARP cleavage and inhibition of denucleation performed with the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk in differentiating cells. However, the caspases implicated are unknown, both caspase-3 and -9 are putative mediators of denucleation [149][150][151]. Caspases have also been implicated in the differentiation of erythrocytes and dendritic cells [152][153][154][155].\nCaspases are involved in the process of cell fusion. Caspase-8 has been associated with the syncytical fusion of cytotrophoblasts to form syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta. Antisense oligonucleotides for caspase-8 and the caspase-8 inhibitors IETD-cho and Z-IETD-cho reduces fusion in these cells [156].\nCaspases, in particular caspase-3, are also associated with the formation of myotubes from fusion of myoblasts. The link between caspase-3 and myoblast differentiation may occur via mammalian sterile twenty-like kinase cleavage, which is an effector of myoblast differentiation and a caspase-3 substrate. Deletion of caspase-3 in myoblasts or the inhibition of caspase-3 activity via Z-DEVD-fmk treatment has been shown to reduce myotube formation [157].\n\nRole of caspases in cell proliferation\nCaspases are implicated in T-cell proliferation due to the suppression of growth upon treatment with caspase inhibitors [158,159]. Caspase-8 may be involved in this process as the caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP1 has been shown to modulate T-cell proliferation [160]. Similarly, caspase-8 and -6 act as positive regulators of Bcell proliferation. B-cells deficient in caspase-8 have been shown to fail to proliferate in response to LPS and double-stranded DNA in a mouse model [161]. In a second study, inhibition of caspase-6 and -8 caused suppression of B-cell proliferation. Additionally, inhibition of caspase-6 alone blocked Cyclin D induction and CDK 4 expression levels required for cell cycle progression [162].\nIn contrast, caspase-3 may act as a negative regulator of B-cell proliferation. A study by Woo et al. demonstrated increased B-cell proliferation in caspase-3 null mice compared to wild-type specimens. The cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor, p21, is a substrate for caspase-3 and may mediate the anti-proliferative effects of caspase-3 [163].\n\nThe future of caspase therapeutics\nThe potential to produce therapeutics through the regulation of caspases is evident, to date a number of caspase inhibitors, such as Pralnacasan and IDN6556, have demonstrated beneficial therapeutic effects upon administration. However, there are a number of challenges in the development of safe and effective drugs. One major obstacle is the lack of knowledge regarding the role of caspases in certain apoptosis-associated diseases, and an incomplete understanding of the different cell death pathways that contribute to these diseases. Information regarding the therapeutic window for administration is also required. Administration of caspase therapeutics without this information may have deleterious effects to the patient.\nAnother challenge facing the utilization of caspase therapeutics is the development of adverse effects upon treatment. Off-target effects may occur due to lack of drug specificity leading to the modulation of non-target caspases or indeed unrelated proteins.\nAdditionally, interference with non-apoptotic or non-inflammatory roles of caspases may result in adverse effects and must also be considered. Research relating to the long-term consequences of caspase inhibition, in particular for the treatment of chronic conditions, is required to determine the safety of these drugs and the future of caspase therapeutics.\nWrite a numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing:1.  to their to the to the to to a specific and for these and in the for a on to the to have the to other to be to inflammatory cytokines to this (R and B to have the in  to the to the to the to the to other to a to the in activation and with the to a and to some to the to the to  and the to this to and in and of the to the to the to these of to on these to the to the to a and the to the to this to the to and to one to an to these to and to this to a to the to on to the to the to to to the in to a to to the to the to the to  to and to the to to the to the and to to the to the to the to the to the and to to the to to to the to these to 2- to a to the to a to the to the and to the to the to a to its in to apoptosis and is to these to the to be and to as to other to C and this to [8 in the to C to the and to a to the to (A and to and to C to these on to 4.

How gratitude can change your brain for the better\nResearchers at the University of California (2012) found that gratitude helps us process and express positive feelings more easily. A neuroimaging study examined the brains of 19 participants as they participated in a gratitude exercise which involved writing a letter of gratitude and reading it to the recipient. It was found that those expressing gratitude had greater neural sensitivity in brain regions associated with the processing of positive feeling, particularly social connection. This increased sensitivity was also observed in the brain regions associated with moral cognition and reward.\u00a0 The changes were still evident in the participants 3 weeks after the gratitude exercise.\nWhy gratitude?\nIf we are grateful for our family and friends and life in general, it means we appreciate the fact that we have them in our lives. The very act of gratitude gives us the feelings associated with having them in our lives \u2013 love, appreciation, and respect. When we hold these in our hearts, the very nature of our inner life shifts and is elevated.\nGratitude also allows us to see life as a gift. If we are grateful for life in general, we automatically view life as a gift. By viewing our lives as a gift, we can see them not as something that is happening to us, but as something that we are consciously involved in.\nA very important difference in attitude, and a very big contribution to better mental health and wellbeing.\n4.

Guests stay in a 10,000-square-foot western-style lodge and ski and ride mountains rising to more than 11,000 feet out of the Great Basin foothills. The company operates on more than 200,000 acres featuring everything from wide-open bowls to Alaska-like fall lines.

Get your extreme game on at 2,200-acre Alta by hiking Baldy Chutes (if they\u2019re open), or traverse over from the Sugarloaf lift to Devil\u2019s Castle.

Together they serve up more than 7,000 acres (5,289 and 1,815, respectively) of prime Colorado skiing and riding. And getting to each is easy: Fly direct to Eagle County Airport from LAX, or fly to Denver International Airport and hop on the resort-owned Colorado Mountain Express shuttle, offering door-to-door transportation.\nCelebrating its 30th anniversary, Beaver Creek prides itself on its pampering, from hosting free daily \u201cCookie Time\u201d\u2014warm, fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies served at 3 p.m.\u2014and \u201cDisco Skate Night\u201d to having a fleet of ambassadors on hand to answer questions and show you the best lines.

That makes the hard part deciding where to go. Both 2010 Olympic hosts get plastered with more than 400 inches of snow each year, and offer terrain from knee-buckling couloirs to mirror-smooth groomers.

Brit. Emp. s. 400 / 120 / 1, fols. 1-20) and some later papers concerned with financial matters (MSS. Brit. Emp. s 400 / 18a). There are 119 bound volumes \u2013 minutes of meetings, ledgers and registers, and printed material \u2013 and 32 boxes of correspondence and other records including the complete series of annual reports.

The award is being presented for the Autumn 2018 edition of the journal. Laura Flanders is the host and executive producer of \u201cThe Laura Flanders Show,\u201d a program that explores racist, sexist and economic exclusionary policies. Dave Lindorff is an investigative journalist who has reported on the Pentagon\u2019s misleading annual financial reports. He also runs the alternative news site This Can\u2019t Be Happening! Aaron Mat\u00e9 is an independent journalist who has contributed to The Nation with pieces about the Mueller investigation.\nRaza Rumi, director of the Park Center for Independent Media, said there were over 30 submissions for the awards. The Izzy Award is awarded by judges Rumi; Jeff Cohen, retired director of the Park Center for Independent Media and retired associate professor in the Department of Journalism; and Linda Jue, executive director and editor at G.W. Williams Center for Independent Journalism in San Francisco. The awards are given to journalists who have exhibited \u201coutstanding achievement in independent media,\u201d according to the Park Center for Independent Media\u2019s website. Rumi said that like previous Izzy winners, the recipients have always been advocates for telling the truth and have had major impacts on national politics and political conversations. He said the award signifies the importance of independent media among claims of fake news in today\u2019s media environment.\nThe award is given in honor of I.F. \u201cIzzy\u201d Stone, a politically radical American investigative journalist and writer of the 20th century.

to automatically learn a multi-modal image question answer model for open domains. \u00a0These questions were created by crowdsourcing. \u00a0For example, for \u201cwhat is the color of the sun?,\u201d our system retrieves the first image and then extracts the correct answer \u201cyellow\u201d from it. \u00a0However, we are able to generalize to more difficult and complex natural language questions like \u201cis the sun brighter than the moon?\u201d and the answer \u201cyes.\u201d In this paper, we provide a more comprehensive set of image QA datasets which we used to measure the performance of our system, as well as results of experiments showing that our system outperforms the previous best method. 2. \u00a0We introduce an unsupervised approach to the problem of learning the order of facts and the structure of their relationships from raw text data. \u00a0Our approach relies on a series of models that map sentences to vectors, and then use a variant of the graph learning algorithm for generating order from these vectors. \u00a0Our approach is flexible in that it learns the model for generating the order from data automatically, in contrast to previous work that requires manually labeled data. 3. \u00a0This paper investigates the use of deep learning models to infer the structure of natural language sentences using a generative approach, and compare it with models that use the conventional conditional approach. \u00a0We develop an unsupervised generative model that uses only a single dataset of natural language sentences. \u00a0To show its effectiveness, we perform experiments on multiple datasets, including a set of sentences from the children\u2019s book The Little Prince, a set of text descriptions from the ImageNet Challenge, and a set of sentences from the Wikipedia. \u00a0Our approach is able to learn the structure of sentences on all of these datasets, and our results are better than the best previous method. 4. \u00a0In this paper, we introduce a new approach to the problem of learning and predicting information in text. \u00a0Our approach uses a generative model based on a neural network, which generates a list of words. \u00a0We compare our method to a standard conditional method (such as the standard Bayes Net), and a variational Bayesian model that does not use any neural networks. \u00a0We show that our method

This creates a repair focus which allows efficient processing of the break. By studying the 3D organization of chromatin using Chromosome Conformation Capture techniques, scientists have shown that interacting genomic domains called TADs are functional units of the response to DNA breaks. This work, published in Nature, shows that the process of establishing TADs by loop extrusion plays a major role in the rapid formation of these favorable foci for DNA repair.\nDouble-Strand Breaks (DSB) are an extremely toxic damage to the DNA, and its repair is therefore essential to preserve the integrity of chromosomes. In response to the appearance of a DSB in the genome, the ATM kinase phosphorylates the histone H2AX variant over a very large domain, in the order of one megabase (one million base pairs), in a few minutes, thus creating a focus for repair.

Of particular importance are the TADs (Topologically Associating Domains), which are domains enriched in chromatin interactions, each corresponding to a key unit of this chromatin organization. It has been proposed that TADs emerge from a loop extrusion process. According to this model, once associated with chromatin, a ring of Cohesin molecules surrounds the DNA to form a loop, which gradually widens as Cohesin actively extrudes the DNA. This process ends when Cohesin encounters particular sequences called strong boundary elements that mark the boundaries of the TAD.

The authors thus propose a new model to explain, on the one hand, how the repair sites are assembled, and on the other hand, the speed of this assembly, and thus involving TADs as functional units of the cellular response to DNA damage.\nThis work has shown the major role of chromosome conformation in maintaining genome integrity while highlighting for the first time an example of chromatin modification through the loop extrusion process.\nLoop extrusion as a mechanism for formation of DNA damage repair foci.\n\nWrite a numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing:1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.", "completion_only": "1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 35, "avg_token_entropy": 0.027621124058975568, "avg_token_perplexity": 1.0998248409617657, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

On August 15, 2017, the Company disclosed, in part, that \"[c]omparable store sales for the quarter were flat.\" On this news, the Company\u2019s share price fell from $109.32 per share to $87.08 per share on August 15, a decline of 20%.\nIf you currently own Advance Auto Parts common stock and are interested in discussing your rights, or have information relating to this investigation, please contact Brett Stecker toll free at |||PHONE_NUMBER|||  or email Mr. Stecker at |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| Brett D.

It might start half way through depending on your statement period.\nSo, if your statement period starts on 15th of the month, you\u00e2ll have 55 days interest free from the 15th.\nYour statement period and due date are both included in your monthly statement so it\u00e2s a good thing to keep an eye on so you know what cut off date in the following month you need to pay your credit card by so you don\u00e2t pay any interest.\nIt\u00e2s also important to know rules changes, special conditions apply and different banks may apply additional or different rules for their credit cards. For example, if you have a balance transfer on your card you typically won\u00e2t receive any interest free days at all.\nHow do you keep on top of your credit card purchases? Let us know over on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter.\nA standard cash advance is withdrawing cash from your credit card. But since this isn\u2019t considered a purchase, interest-free days don\u00e2t apply. This means interest starts to add up from the moment you make the withdrawal.\nCash advances should be a last resort or in case of an emergency.

But remember, the interest charged for cash is usually quite high, so try to pay it back as soon as possible.\ntraveller\u00e2s cheques or gift cards.\nYou can usually prevent interest charges altogether on your credit card. The simplest way to never pay interest and maintain your monthly grace period between statements and payment due dates is to simply align your payments with all due dates, statement periods and policies associated with your credit card. Never carry any balance and youll avoid interest altogether.\nIf you pay your full monthly balance by the end of every month, you aren\u2019t charged interest.\nIf you pay the prior months balance in full, then pay less than your full monthly balance by the end of the month, you\u2019re only charged interest on the unpaid portion up until the date you pay it off. To avoid seeing interest charges completely, pay your monthly balance in full by the due date for two consecutive months.\nApple Card1 makes it easy to see how much you need to pay to lower or avoid interest charges2 on your balance.\nWhen you go to make a payment in the Wallet app, Apple Card automatically estimates the amount of interest you pay based on the payment amount you choose.\nInterest charge estimates are based on the selected payment, taking into account your remaining balance from the previous month, plus new purchases this month at the time you view your account balance. Estimates don\u2019t include pending transactions, credits received from disputes on purchases made during the current month, or any other purchases or payments you might make before the end of the billing period. The actual interest charge each month appear on your monthly statement.\nWhen you carry a balance from one billing cycle into the next, most credit cards charge interest using the average daily balance method. You can calculate your cards daily interest rate by dividing the APR on your card by the 365 days in a year. Each day you carry a balance, if your card charges interest based on the average daily balance method, youll be charged based on the balance from the day before. The higher your cards APR, the greater the interest youll accumulate each day.\nFor example, for a credit card with an APR of 17%, the rate per day would be .17/365, or 0.000466%. That daily rate interest is then multiplied by your balance that day. Since the average daily balance is compounded, each day the calculation is based on the day before.\nSo you have a balance on Day 1 of $10,000, on Day 2, your card would have a balance of $10,004.66, which is what you get when you multiply the balance of $10,000 by the daily rate of 0.000466. This means the balance of $10,004.66 on Day 2 would also be subject to the daily rate of 0.0466%, making your balance $10,009.32 on Day 3 and so on until the end of that months billing cycle.\nHowever, if you pay your bill in full by the end of the month, you wont have to pay any interest at all.\nIf you miss a payment date or are unable to pay off a credit card in full because of financial hardship, you should reach out to your bank directly. Especially if you have an excellent or good credit score already, or if this is the first time youve been unable to make a payment on time, your credit card company may be willing to work with you. Reach out before you miss a payment date if at all possible.\nIf you miss a payment due date but are able to pay off the full amount soon after, you can sometimes request a refund on the interest or late fee charge. If paying off the card looks to be a more drawn-out process, you can also apply for a personal loan with many card companies though in this case you will also want to keep in mind the interest rate of the loan and fully understand what will be different terms than those of your credit card.\nIf you couldn\u2019t pay for the purchases at the end of the 55 days, you would be charged interest. That interest is calculated from the end of the 31 day statement period, in this case, that\u2019s January 31. In 2019, new legislation meant that banks charged interest from the end of the statement period instead of the date the purchase was made.\nSo, for the example above, you would start being charged interest on the $95 from January 31 \u00e2 not January 1 and January 17.\nHow your is calculated may vary depending on who you bank with. At CommBank, we calculate interest from the day each purchase is made up until it\u2019s repaid in full. This applies to all purchases unless you\u2019re eligible for an interest-free period.\nIf you have a balance transfer or instalment plan, the interest rate we use will be shown when you apply. Applicable interest charges and interest rates can also be found on your monthly .\nCarrying a balance on a card usually forfeits the grace period. This means if you dont pay off a monthly balance in full by the due date, you will not have a grace period for paying off transactions the following month. You will be charged interest on the outstanding balance, as well as all transactions in the new statement period from the date of transaction. In order to regain your interest-free grace period, try to pay off all debt as quickly as possible. Depending on your cardholder agreement, it may take a couple months to earn the grace period back.\nTo avoid carrying balances into future statement periods, do not wait until exact due dates to pay off balances. If you cannot pay off your full balance by the end of the month, pay as much as you can before the deadline and try to keep paying as often as possible in whatever amounts you are able. Even if your next due date is not until later in the new statement month, if you carry an outstanding balance you will be accumulating interest every day of that month.\nI have made a balance transfer with 0% APR for 12 months and paid only the minimum for 12 months. I wasn\u2019t charged any interest and if I pay the balance in full before 12 months is over, I don\u2019t get charged any interest. This, I understand.\nYou might also want to calculate what APR you actually paid ifyou paid 10% of the outstanding balance for 11 months and a lump sumfor the rest at the end of the 12th and comparethat to the touted 0.0% rate.\nIf you have multiple credit cards to pay off each month, it may be possible to request a change in your statement and payment due dates. Usually these are set up at the time of opening a new account. Unfortunately, this means that many card holders have to juggle more than one statement period and pay off different cards at different times in the month. For some people this may work to an advantage depending on what each card is used for and how they choose to fund each payment. For many of us, it may be simpler and easier to remember due dates if our banks align all our statement periods to conclude at the same time each month.\nThe only way to avoid interest charges on your credit card is to pay your balance in full by your payment due date. Our golden rule has always been to set-up pre-authorized payments from your checking account for the entire balance of your credit card statement on the payment due date. Youll never be late again.

Thanks to anyone who can help!\nWhy does my tree have brown leaves?\nI had my landscape company trim my trees and the leaves that fell had some brownish black color in the center of the leaf.

I also had the landscape company add some fertilizer and they used an earthworm additive to the fertilizer. They told me that the brownish color was due to the fertilizer and that it should all be gone in a month and that my tree was not sick.

{"random_doc_file_path": "/home/eisape/projects/diversify_lm_output/dolma/data/v1_5r2_sample-0041.json.gz", "random_doc": "For the first five years of this site, I have mostly discussed companies I found attractively valued for investment, as well as my dividend investing strategy. However, I rarely discussed the companies I have been purchasing in my accounts. This is because I believed that it was much better to discuss the tools of the trade and my investment philosophy and ideas, rather than focus too much in on recent investments. I never even published my investment portfolio in detail, until recently. Readers could only guess what I owned by going through articles, and checking my full disclosures. However, through interactions with readers over the years, I have realized that some enjoy reading about specific investment ideas that I have added money to.\nI would hate to turn this site into a stock picking service, but if there is interest, I would keep posting recent investments. As was the cash with my Roth IRA investments, I am going to post those in a couple weeks. I do post the tickers on Twitter, the day I make the transactions in that portfolio.\nI\u2019ve been following your blog for quite a while and I really appreciate all the hard work you put into your stock analyses. I think yours is one of the best blogs out there and I take all of your recommendations to heart. That being said, I like that you\u2019re expanding in to options strategies, but I\u2019m curious why you would sell a LEAP when you could get a better return with less market exposure by selling shorter term puts at lower strike prices for better entry points? For example, you could sell the November 1st $40.00 put for $55.00. With 30 days until expiration, you\u2019re risking $4,000 to make $55.00, which comes out to an annualized yield of 16.72% ($55 / 30 days x 365 / $4000 x 100). If exercised, you get into the stock at $40.00 instead of $42.00 which represents a $200 savings to your LEAPS strategy. Moreover, with the LEAPS strategy, you\u2019re exposed to the market for 472 days and your annualized yield is only 9.57%. ($520 / 472 days x 365 / $4200 x 100). By repeating the process with short term options at strike prices slightly lower than the stock\u2019s current price, you could make the same amount of money in approximately 9-10 months as you could by selling LEAP options with expiration dates 15 months out. Sure, there may be tax advantages over selling LEAPS over short term options, but I think the potential lower entry points and shorter term market risk might outweigh that advantage if you\u2019re looking to stay in the stock for the long term if you happen to get exercised. I would love to hear your thoughts on this as I'm primarily utilizing a short term put selling strategy to get better entry points into the Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Champions that I want to own for the long term.\nDGI, I also added some BP to my taxable account not so long ago. While the company is still mired in legal issues, the compelling valuation discount and likely dividend growth potential makes this a very attractive play,for the reasons you outlined. I also see non renewable energy prices heading higher in the long term from here.\nBeen following you for a year, and I too really appreciate your though research. I suspect we're all to savey to allow this to become our \"stock picking service.\" But I think sharing your purchases and sells can both alert us to options we'd missed, and awaken us to problems we may be missing. So I for one encourage you to continue to share your actions and the reasons that inform them.\nThank you for reading the site. I am experimenting in ways to generate \"float\" by selling long-dated puts on stocks I want to purchase, and collecting the premium if options are not exercised.\nI don't think you can compare the results of selling a Jan 2015 put once with selling a near term put multiple times through Jan 2015 (14 -or 15 times per your example). This is because you don't know if you would be able to collect premium for 15 months by selling near term puts, as you don't know how often it would get exercised.\nYou are also not taking into consideration the effect of commissions on your transactions. Assuming you keep selling a put once/month, and it never go exercised, you would end up paying $75 ( 15 transactions times 5 dollars/trade). With my example, I am paying just one commissions.\nYou are not taking into consideration the float I am generating - this is $500 I can invest in something ( and I did use it as a downpayment on my actual BP purchase). Given the 5% yield at the moment, I can reasonably expect to earn about $30 or so in dividends on that amount.\nLast but not least, you are not taking into consideration the fact that if BP trades below $42 in January 2015, I would be able to purchase the stock essentially at prices below $37. This is 42 strike prices minus $5, equals a $37 effective cost. This was specifically mentioned in the article.\nYou hit the nail on the head! I think that the stock is priced for failure. In reality, BP will likely outlive every one of us. (even if we are still here 50 years from now). That is a lot of dividend checks to collect, and yes, they will amount to much more than the purchase price today.\nI would also like to see your process in selecting and purchasing a stock. Also the options strategies are helpful as I'm trying to learn similar strategies.\nYou have one of the best sites and I have recommended it to a number of DGI's I know. I already own O and BP but it is good to have more confirmation of my opinion.\ni'm curious why your purchased O for your taxable account and have its divies taxed at your ordinary tax rate. To be honest I've also considered to buy in my taxable account but haven't yet.

I think yours is one of the best blogs out there and I take all of your recommendations to heart. That being said, I like that you\u2019re expanding in to options strategies, but I\u2019m curious why you would sell a LEAP when you could get a better return with less market exposure by selling shorter term puts at lower strike prices for better entry points? For example, you could sell the November 1st $40.00 put for $55.00. With 30 days until expiration, you\u2019re risking $4,000 to make $55.00, which comes out to an annualized yield of 16.72% ($55 / 30 days x 365 / $4000 x 100). If exercised, you get into the stock at $40.00 instead of $42.00 which represents a $200 savings to your LEAPS strategy. Moreover, with the LEAPS strategy, you\u2019re exposed to the market for 472 days and your annualized yield is only 9.57%. ($520 / 472 days x 365 / $4200 x 100). By repeating the process with short term options at strike prices slightly lower than the stock\u2019s current price, you could make the same amount of money in approximately 9-10 months as you could by selling LEAP options with expiration dates 15 months out. Sure, there may be tax advantages over selling LEAPS over short term options, but I think the potential lower entry points and shorter term market risk might outweigh that advantage if you\u2019re looking to stay in the stock for the long term if you happen to get exercised. I would love to hear your thoughts on this as I'm primarily utilizing a short term put selling strategy to get better entry points into the Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Champions that I want to own for the long term.\nDGI, I also added some BP to my taxable account not so long ago. While the company is still mired in legal issues, the compelling valuation discount and likely dividend growth potential makes this a very attractive play,for the reasons you outlined. I also see non renewable energy prices heading higher in the long term from here.\nBeen following you for a year, and I too really appreciate your though research. I suspect we're all to savey to allow this to become our \"stock picking service.\" But I think sharing your purchases and sells can both alert us to options we'd missed, and awaken us to problems we may be missing. So I for one encourage you to continue to share your actions and the reasons that inform them.\nThank you for reading the site. I am experimenting in ways to generate \"float\" by selling long-dated puts on stocks I want to purchase, and collecting the premium if options are not exercised.\nI don't think you can compare the results of selling a Jan 2015 put once with selling a near term put multiple times through Jan 2015 (14 -or 15 times per your example). This is because you don't know if you would be able to collect premium for 15 months by selling near term puts, as you don't know how often it would get exercised.\nYou are also not taking into consideration the effect of commissions on your transactions. Assuming you keep selling a put once/month, and it never go exercised, you would end up paying $75 ( 15 transactions times 5 dollars/trade). With my example, I am paying just one commissions.\nYou are not taking into consideration the float I am generating - this is $500 I can invest in something ( and I did use it as a downpayment on my actual BP purchase). Given the 5% yield at the moment, I can reasonably expect to earn about $30 or so in dividends on that amount.\nLast but not least, you are not taking into consideration the fact that if BP trades below $42 in January 2015, I would be able to purchase the stock essentially at prices below $37. This is 42 strike prices minus $5, equals a $37 effective cost. This was specifically mentioned in the article.\nYou hit the nail on the head! I think that the stock is priced for failure. In reality, BP will likely outlive every one of us. (even if we are still here 50 years from now). That is a lot of dividend checks to collect, and yes, they will amount to much more than the purchase price today.\nI would also like to see your process in selecting and purchasing a stock. Also the options strategies are helpful as I'm trying to learn similar strategies.\nYou have one of the best sites and I have recommended it to a number of DGI's I know. I already own O and BP but it is good to have more confirmation of my opinion.\ni'm curious why your purchased O for your taxable account and have its divies taxed at your ordinary tax rate.

Even though we didn't get the victory, it feels good that I can help out the team.\"\n182 \u2014 Austin Taylor (BS) d Aiden Smith, 6-5. 195 \u2014 Seth Egolf (W) p Sam Geiling, 0:25. 220 \u2014 Forrest Rhyne (W) d Damon James, 9-3. 285 \u2014 Nick Trent (BS) d Shawn Robinson, 6-2. 106 \u2014 No match. 113 \u2014 Kollin Myers (BS) p Laken Rouzer, 4:50. 120 \u2014 Collin Nester (BS) d Elliott Swink, 8-3. 126 \u2014 Tristan Hanshaw (BS) p Nick Stouffer, 3:27. 132 \u2014 Lucas Shoop (BS) p Logan Klipp, 3:04. 138 \u2014 Cole Wetzel (BS) p Dalton Mowen, 3:44. 145 \u2014 AJ Kostyak (BS) d Cody Frey, 8-4. 152 \u2014 Patrick Zimmerer (W) d Nick Kostyak, 6-5. 160 \u2014 Noah Carmack (W) won by forfeit. 170 \u2014 Travis Wickard (BS) md Quinten Harris, 9-1.\nBoiling Springs was deducted 1 team point for unsportsmanlike conduct on the bench.\n\nWrite a numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing:1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. 45. 46. 47. 48. 49. 50. 51. 52. 53. 54. 55. 56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. 67. 68. 69. 70. 71. 72. 73. 74. 75. 76. 77. 78. 79. 80. 81. 82. 83. 84. 85. 86. 87. 88. 89. 90. 91. 92. 93. 94. 95. 96. 97. 98. 99. 100.", "completion_only": "2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. 45. 46. 47. 48. 49. 50. 51. 52. 53. 54. 55. 56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. 67. 68. 69. 70. 71. 72. 73. 74. 75. 76. 77. 78. 79. 80. 81. 82. 83. 84. 85. 86. 87. 88. 89. 90. 91. 92. 93. 94. 95. 96. 97. 98. 99. 100.", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 55, "avg_token_entropy": 0.016679401525156397, "avg_token_perplexity": 1.066325127796738, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

I have not had any treatment since then but am having various tests on the 8 th and 9 th with a view to starting caylix the week after.\nI cannot get insurance to cover cancer!! I am worried that the cancer has been growing and I could become ill whilst away, how do I get back and how much would treatment cost in Madeira?\nI feel safe in this country and know if anything happens I will get driven to the Marsden.\nAm I being a wimp, what would be your advice?\nI was in the same position as you last April. Avastin had stopped working and scan showed disease returning. I was about to go onto caelyx but in between we did manage a week in Italy which was lovely but I was not at full strength. I didn't have to defer , the timing worked ....\nIt was going through the airport which worried me the most, standing and hanging around so I took a walking stick, we booked the fast tracking through security at a little extra cost plus the quiet breakfast lounge prior which cut out the crowd milling . This was brilliant and I recommend.\nCan't remember what we did re insurance, I will ask my husband when he wakes up, and post again!\nYou really have to go with your gut feeling. It could make you feel better and be a nice thing to do ( I love Madeira) . Would you be prepared to go without the medical part of insurance ? I reason that not a lot is going to happen in a week re your condition ( it's not like we have a heart or other medical condiotn which COULD suddenly deteriorate orbe worrisome) , yes you may feel worse and have less stamina, strength but if need be you could just suck up the cost of flying back early??\nWe went to Tenerife in December despite my being in lots of pain and blood in my urine.\nWas it a good idea - the sun and food was great for the soul without the pain it would\u2019ve been much better. In that position again I don\u2019t think I\u2019d go. Our game plan was if bleeding got worse or I felt really bad then we\u2019d just book a flight home. We had no insurance but you can get treated for free at a public hospital.\nFirstly, check with your onc if one week\u2019s delay is going to make any difference. If not, then if you fancy going why not? Especially if you have no pain. If you really cannot get insurance to cover your cancer, do still take medical insurance, you might fall and break a leg!

People who suffer from this condition usually feel pain or tension in their jaw muscles upon waking up along with teeth sensitivity and worn-out teeth.\nWhat Can a Night Guard Do to Help?\nA custom-made occlusal night guard can help eliminate the symptoms of bruxism along with relieving you from teeth and jaw pain that occur because of it. A night guard acts as a barrier between your top and bottom teeth and protects them from the impact of grinding and clenching.\nHow Can It Effect Your Sleep?\nNot only can the symptoms of bruxism interrupt and disturb your sleep but they can also make you feel groggy and unpleasant when you wake up due to not getting a good night\u2019s rest. A night guard can help improve your sleep by reducing the stress on your jaw muscles and relieving you from headaches and jaw pain.\nCan Night Guards Prevent Tooth Damage?\nBruxism can cause considerable damage to your teeth in the form of chipping and cracking.

In natural language processing (NLP) research, the question has been raised as to whether it is better to have models with small numbers of features or large numbers of features. 2.  The first attempt to answer this question was a project that investigated whether there is a general principle about how large a model size can be before it is not a beneficial. 3.  The answer was yes: 4.  For any fixed feature distribution, there exists a size beyond which adding additional features no longer improves the model. 5.  But this may not be a useful result, because there was no way to find the optimal feature count without knowing the optimal feature count in advance. 6.  Thus, the next question was whether there is a way to learn the optimal model size for a task. 7.  This was done in a project that developed algorithms that tried to determine how many features to use. 8.  These were tested on the following tasks: 9.  part-of-speech tagging, word classification, dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, machine translation, and syntactic constituency parsing. 10.  The results showed that a model size between three and eight features gives the best results in all tasks. 11.  The model also showed that a good model for one task is likely to be a good model for another task. 12.  This work was published in the 2018 edition of the ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data. 13.  Finally, the project investigated whether it is beneficial to increase the model size to more than eight features. 14.  For a large percentage of tasks, it is not. 15.  The results showed that there is an optimum model size and that larger sizes are generally worse than smaller sizes for natural language processing tasks. 16.  This work was published in a paper called \"Size Does Not Matter: Experiments in the Empirical Search for the Optimal Model Size in Natural Language Processing\" in the 2016 International Conference on Machine Learning. 17.  The project used the Stanford part-of-speech tagger to train a model using the Penn Treebank corpus. 18.  A corpus is a large body of text. 19.

NLP uses language and context to derive meaning from the words we use, the order of the words we use, and even our tone. In this chapter we will discuss NLP, its current role in artificial intelligence, as well as its future prospects and how it will help improve your ability to communicate with computer applications.3 0 What Is Natural Language Processing?4 Natural language processing (NLP) deals with human language, as it is spoken or written. It involves developing software applications that analyze large amounts of text or speech data, and then extract patterns, information, or data. As humans, we tend to interpret information based on our own experiences and beliefs; however, computers can use information processing to extract meaning from what we say without bias.5 0 Challenges in Natural Language Processing6 It is very difficult for computers to recognize human emotions through a series of words. It is even more difficult for computers to understand sarcasm and humor. Another challenge lies in understanding different accents, dialects, and colloquialisms.7 0 Applications of Natural Language Processing8 Natural language processing can be applied to a variety of tasks, from question and answer systems to sentiment analysis. For example, question and answer systems are programs that allow users to ask a question and receive an answer.9 0 Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence10 Because computers can analyze massive amounts of data, they can help improve how we interact with other people and artificial intelligence systems.11 0 History of Natural Language Processing12 Language processing has been around since the 1950s, when computers were still primarily used for mathematical calculations. At first, computers were programmed to recognize commands, but as programming languages evolved, they became more sophisticated, with greater capabilities for recognizing human speech.13 0 Natural Language Processing Today14 Current NLP methods consist of two steps: preprocessing and analysis. Preprocessing involves removing unwanted words, such as punctuation and numbers, and converting text to lowercase letters. Analysis then analyzes the text to identify patterns or relevant words.15 0 Where We Are Today16 NLP techniques have made great strides in recent years, but we still have a long way to go.

I\u2019m as white as you can get and might be a bit concerned for my safety. Beyond that issue, it\u2019d be my pleasure to visit with you and hear you speak.\nI still don\u2019t get how the murder of innocent people of any color can ever be justified under any circumstances\u2026Regardless of how terribly one\u2019s ancestors were abused and enslaved\u2026how can that help your cause?\nToo, why wish bad things to befall others? Doesn\u2019t that just FEEL bad inside?\nAnyway \u2013 drop me a line and hopefully we can chat.\n Im 14 and he was my bestfriend and these fuckers mock the issue as if it is all a joke.\nIf that isn\u2019t Divine Justice, I don\u2019t know what is!\nThese dogs had opportunity to embrace love but chose their hatred, perversion and greed.\nThey deserve it times 7.\nAs for the calcification of the Pineal gland, this is caused by consumption of fluoride (in tap water and toothpaste) so we are all affected no matter what color our skin is.\nAnyway, thanks for the few minutes of mild amusement.\nCheck \u201cWestern facts\u201d or true knowledge? The incidence of what you call \u201cskin cancer\u201d in Africa is a result of not worshiping the Sun of God through the 3rd Eye but, rather, being, living and looking at the sun like devils do. Human evolution and Divine extermination are occuring before us.\nThe only devil here is you.\n\nVooDoo was/is science.\nYou find may find the new (but ancient) Ultraviolet Light sciences intriguing.\n  What happens when there\u2019re no more whites to steal from? \nThe bible wasn\u2019t written by the fake jews. There were no whites living in the holy lands at the time the holy books were written. Whites were cave dwellers , and they took the traditions and wrote themselves into history and tried to write us out, except they couldn\u2019t blast away (all) of the black faces on the statues and art in the tombs of Egypt and other places, that prove we were God\u2019s original people.(smile) Blacks have worked for hundreds of years in this country, and were denied everything we tried to have.  We are left depending on a wicked system to see us through, (the system of in God we trust) and the media put our face on this shit, like we brought all the guns and drugs into this country ourselves. War on drugs was really a war on the black man. A black person can\u2019t get a loan to start a business. What jobs there are, are not paying anything.College is so expensive, that your career is obsolete before you can pay the loan off. The banks did predatory lending practices on blacks and latinos so they can lose their homes, so what the hell are we to do? Your people created all this hate, and it has come back on you, because you put all blacks in the same category. You see one black person doing something and say that (all) blacks do it.  You\u2019re going to one day wake up, and be in bondage, and wonder what happened.\nBless you brother. Your knowledge is rich and your patience is beautiful.  I often wonder what good it does to cast such pearls before these swine, though. For, they are a) ignorant of it; b) reject it; or c) deny it. Yet such truths that you speak, must be said.\nOh you said that well!\nThe only negros around during biblical times were the \u201cbeasts of the field\u201d.\nBeasts of the field are seperate from farm animals etc\u2026 in that they could work closely and communicate with man. They could also communicate with god.\nNegros were put on this planet in africa sorta like a stockyard. They were put there for \u201cman\u201d to take and use.\nYour, negro, dna is just a tad off from human dna..you can walk and talk and mimic humans well but there are subtle differences to seperate you. That jutting jaw, the fact that you have no soul. The fact that you can read yet not understand gods word.\nWhen we used to go fishing in georgia we would always take a young negro boy with us..getting stuck out in those swamps sometimes the boat motor would get hung up in some dumbasses trot lines or would shear a pin on a cypress knee\u2026we would use a young negro boy to hop into the snake and alligator infested waters to untangle the mess or to help get the motor up and in a position where the prop could be cleared or the pin replaced.\nOn many occasions back in those swamps we would just leave the boy after repairing the motor and on some occasions when we didnt have need of his services any longer we would either put him out on a body of land or simply toss him over the side in the middle of the swamp.\nNever lost one bit of sleep over it because he was there to serve us\u2026.just an animal\u2026a beast and a souless one at that\u2026.\nA bit like leaving a dog or cat out there\u2026he could either find his way back home or become food for the swamp.\nSatan has just revealed himself. See how barbaric these people are? He just PROVED that he has no soul from what he just posted. Nothing in the animal kingdom is as low as the white man. (Show me one place in the bible, where it its alright to kill people, and show me where it says BLACK people were beasts of the field.That\u2019s YOUR interpretation) The Bible says that Ethiopia and Egypt were at their FULL MIGHT. And they were not beasts in anyone\u2019s field. Whites were not fit to even be in the field, that;s why they stayed in caves for years.\nThey call themselves civilized. They need to look up the word civil, and they would see that they are far from it, and hanging, raping, mamimg and burning is not civilized. There\u2019s a difference between civilizing people and colonizing them. yeah, they did a lot of colonizing, and they\u2019d go to church Sunday morning praising their god, and go nigga hanging that same night. There is no human in them. The bible tells us that there\u2019s a man who is \u201cdevoid of soul.\u201d This is why it\u2019s so easy for them to do things like hang and burn people, and still be able to sleep at night. All he\u2019s doing, is confirming what we knew all along. And if we are \u201cbeasts of the field\u201d, then no wonder whites are mad, because they have a lot of catching up to do.  They\u2019re white, and they still can\u2019t get over. So much for being superior, to let a\u201d beast\u201d pass you up like that. LOL ! LOL! LOL! LOL! LOL!\nAnd Yacub called the name of the place pineal: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\nThat is a very good telling discription of having an abnormal pineal gland. You things have no human feelings, you would do the same thing to a white if need be. Just like whites enslaved white, you have no human conscious.\nThis Afronazi BLack Supremacist perspective is no different from any white racism. Can\u2019t you see its this idea of duality that separating all of us as humans and creating more racism this whole us and them, us the victims and them the evil white man, listen we are all one and the same get over yourselves, yes some white colonists did some bad things hundreds of years ago, the time is now and we are all part of the same consciousness made of pure vibrating energy and to elevate our souls as a planet we need to work together not demonize others blaming them for our problems and not taking responsibility for our own fates.\nMy African and Non White brothers see in your hearts that we are all in the same and that we must work together with love as our intention and not get caught up in all this bs (belief systems) if your soul does not show you the way then maybe a triptamine or 2 will point you in the right direction.\nIn realising we are your dark side, when will you be prepared to let go of it and bask in the light?\n Why don\u2019t you all get together and do a mass suicide. Drink some poisoned grape kool-aid.\n \nHopefully that day will come sooner or later. \n\nMy skin is black upon me.\nTo the one who made the comment about whites keeping us alive.\n I want someone to show one instance where they\u2019re keeping us alive.  They\u2019re just jealous because their women want us, and to think that the people who did all these things to us are representing Christ!\n My God!\nHow easy a comment to refute!\n White donations to Africa, whites giving you every ample oppertunity to move forward, every unfair advantage.\nYou said white people took niggers into slavery? \nWe were in caves while you were prospering?  You were raping babies to cure aids and living in mudhuts while the white man was building beautiful civilizations.\n1) Why did the niggers sell each other as slaves?\nThe most dangerous thing to a black these days is another black.\n\nI have to say this. They didn\u2019t take the chains off our bodies until the mental chains were on tight. We were labeled a sin and taught self hatred for 400 years, and white supremacy reigned supreme.  The best kind of slave to have is one who thinks he\u2019s free. If you don\u2019t treat a person as human, they wont respond as human. If you don\u2019t believe it, treat some WHITE kids like that for ONE DAY, and you will have some mass murderers on your hands.\nThough he has access to the truth,Shattered Dreams, resoundingly embraces ignorance.\n The money that is donated to africa gets used to poison the ground and turn it into desert land, so blacks won\u2019t be able to plant and help themselves, like I said before. I guess whites didn\u2019t have anything to do with the slaves getting over here, whether they were sold to your people or not, They knew it was wrong.\nYou don\u2019t have to buy something just because someone is selling it. Any \u201cHistory\u201d you\u2019re reading was written back in the Jim Crow days, when they were dehumanizing black people, so you already know there would be nothing in our favor written in those \u201cLieBury\u201d books. Black people were living in mud huts because they were nomads, who were trying to escape the white man\u2019s evil rath. They would put scars on their daughters faces to make them undesirable to the white man (and his barbaric lust for black flesh), so they wouldn\u2019t get kidnapped and raped.\nThey knew if they tried to build a city and stay in one place, they would be killed.  \nI am black, but comely.\nRondeux,agreed with your comment,WHO also introduced hiv to the gay community in sanfrancisco. Wonder what the swine flu vac has in mind?  \nDamn! Let these despicable, delusional, psychotic cavemen have it Rondeux.\nBlacks enslave Blacks in Africa, Muslims started the slave trade in Africa. Whites enslave whites and society has evolved to the point where this practice is only seen among tribes in underdeveloped nations. The colonists tried to enslave whites such as the Irish but they could easily escape and blend into the population. Africans could easily be identified and it was harder for them to get together and plan escapes because most of them came from different tribes which meant they had different languages so they couldn\u2019t communicate. They only reason slavery existed was economical not to be supreme among another race. The racism began only when the colonist tried to justify slavery so they wouldn\u2019t lose their workers. But the very nature of slavery in any form is evil so any justification was empty rhetoric intended to distract from the truth.\n\nWhen compared to the estimated 50 million Blacks taken from America and the generations of those born into \u2013 not to mention the racism that has continued to terrorize our lives since, your 3800 should be embarrassing to mention.\nits not about comparison. i was trying to make a point about the society of the time. so I don\u2019t feel embarrassed for my remark. I appreciate the passion though.\nYes, even during slavery the majority of black slaves killed were by other slaves usually over a woman or some petty disagreement.\nThe stories you here of white slavemasters treating their slaves in some sort of inhumane manner is just preposturous.\nSlaves were property that were bought and pain for. They cost money to upkeep and maintain.\nThey were basically the farm machinery of the day and no farmer is going to just destroy or harm a tractor or piece of equipment for no reason because it would be like costing himself good money.\nThere had been a lot of revisionist history written since slavery times. Lot of just downright lies written in order to make it look like the slaves were unduly treated.\nYes, slavery was wrong but those slaves were very well taken care of. Well fed, housed, clothed and given good medical treatment.\nIm sure there were some slave owners who might not have looked after their slaves as well as one should but there are people today who dont maintain their vehicles and equipment as well as the majority of people do.\nSlaves were much better off than a lot of poor white folks who by the way were unable to find good farm work because of the slaves.\nSlaves weren\u2019t freed either, they were fired. The incompetent niggers could not do the job.\nThey are now property of the United States government.\nLOL at the Rawanda niggers using children for human sacrifice. \n  Not one.\nIf you talk to many of the older negros out there you will find that none of them remember any lynchings.\nOut of 100 years there might have been a dozen or so actual lynchings of blacks. Black revisionist historians and white apologists have made the number seem much higher.\nEven after the civil war the crimes committed against negros were rare. Most of the deaths of negros have been by negros themselves.\nRosewood,Greenwood,Watts\u2026 these were riots caused by negros and the situations were aggravated by negro behavior\u2026.with the negro neighborhoods being burned down by the very negros who lived there.\nFirst thing a negro does when in an agitated state is he starts destroying all he has built.. he will burn his own homes and businesses down to the ground and then blame it all on the white man.\n\nWhen compared against the slave empire and legacy of hate and superiority your reprobate forefathers left you, that all you have is silly, little nonsensical naratives is comical.\nWhat happened? Is that all you got? Your forefathers are rolling in their graves.\nTell us all more stories!\nGeorgia Cracker uses factual information between his stories.\nYou do not, you have yet to refute one of his excellent points, you subhuman virus.\nYou fake scoundrel! What\u2019s going on? This isn\u2019t about your fake history. It\u2019s about your calcified Pineal Gland and the end of your world.\nWhile I don\u2019t think I was trying to make the point you\u2019re referencing, I suppose it might apply as well.\nThat doesn\u2019t make the slightest bit of sense. I have no idea what you\u2019re trying to say, but I bet you love me because I\u2019m the only person who gives you any attention.\nI do so because you\u2019re way too much fun.  I bet you really slaughter yo\u2019homies on the downlow, or is more like \u201cslather\u201d on the downlow. mmm? buttercakes?\noop\u2019s I posted in the wrong place.. apologize, Shattered Dreams that comment was meant for the goofy nigger slug-downlow-hter leadfoot.\n\nRespectfully, your skin and faculties are too week to endure the hardships of toil underneath the sun.\nIOWs, plans for what you will spend your time doing have already been made.\nMuslims started the slave trade in Africa, not the white man. So does that make Muslims less than slaves?\nThe first Africans who went into slavery were kidnapped, not traded. While slavery existed in Africa, the form of slavery Caucasians inflicted upon our ancestors (Chattel slavery) hadn\u2019t been previously recorded in history. IOWs, in no other instances where men were slaves had then been stripped of their identity, religion and humanity.\nYou\u2019re right, in any where else in the world a slave could \u201cearn,\u201d their freedom.\nAnd they weren\u2019t treated like commodities.\nWhere does it say that the colonialists from England(not \u201cCaucasians\u201d, but one specific group of white people; I happen to be white and my ancestors were Russian, Irish and Native American and had nothing to do with the Atlantic slave trade) were the only ones to enforce Chattel slavery? The Arabics enslaved a far larger number of Africans and their slave trade lasted far longer(as the Atlantic slave trade was just an offshoot of the Arabic slave trade). Not only that, but the slavery of Africans by Arabics continues in modern northern Africa dispite slavery having been banned there 1981 and criminalized in 2007(as opposed to 1865). Does that make any difference at all? You hate the white man from taking you away from your culture while simultaneously adopting the religion(or a mutation of it) of the Arabs who started the system that brought it on in the first place AND (some)continue to do it. How ironic is it that those radical black muslims talk about the Stockholm Syndrome when referring to \u201chouse niggers\u201d? Ha, maybe if you refuse to see the whole picture. No wonder there\u2019s still an obssession with slavery by African Americans, it\u2019s engrained in your culture. Slavery between Africans was prevelant for years before the Arabs and Europeans ever set foot in Africa, and it is present to this day.  A human is as corruptable as any other. And from someone who had seen the products of the Arabic slave trade: \u201c\u2026We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed through the body and lying on the path. [Onlookers] said an Arab who passed early that morning had done it in anger at losing the price he had given for her, because she was unable to walk any longer. We passed a woman tied by the neck to a tree and dead\u2026\u201d, yeah, that doesn\u2019t sound like Chattel slavery at all. That doesn\u2019t sound as if they were treated like commodities, does it? Even if, as you said, the European colonialists were the first to use Chattel slavery, do the actions of that one specific group in history condone absolute condemnation over the entire race which that group was a member of? I suppose that\u2019s were religious justification comes in, doesn\u2019t it? The fact that the slaves were stripped of their humanity is commentary on the nature of slavery in the country itself. It was/is a capitalistic society that used slavery as a means of economic stability; in the beginning(the important point) it had nothing to do with notions of racial supremacy. There were actually small numbers of enslaved whites(and I\u2019m not talking about endentured servatude). Emotional and psychological justification of the institution of slavery as a means of economic upwelling came in the form of reducing those enslaved to a form of life only fit for slavery, sort of like how the fanatically religious black supremacist justifies his hateful and bigoted views brought on as a backlash against racism by placing the fault of all negativity in the life of a black man on the white man and using heavily distorted scientific fact as a means to support those views and sleep at night. \nThe concept of white supremacy benefitted whites world wide.\nThe idea of white supremacy theoretically benefits whites world-wide, but how many white cultures do you see actively accepting that as an objective system? You cannot hate all whites for the formation of a single social policy regarding the justification of the horrid acts of slavery under the guise of it being a form of economic output by a single specific group of white people simply because it refers to all white people. The concept of black supremacy benefits all blacks, yet I know there are quite a few black people who violently rebuke those teachings and hold themselves completely outside of it. White people at large certainly aren\u2019t attempting to actively destroy African culture. The \u201cwhite\u201d history book teaches the history of the United States with all it\u2019s faults and failings and brutality as well as it\u2019s triumphs. Personally, I\u2019m fascinated by most cultural traditions, including African, which hold influence on my own life. There\u2019s no grounds on eliminating the cultural heritage of any \u201crace\u201d in the progression of a nation, especially the U.S. To look at the United States as a faction of white supremacy is to leave many, many factors unaccounted for. You already understand her history of turmoil and struggle. Apply this to modern times. The assimilation of black people from a psychological level of what they were reduced to by the early southern colonialists who took economic advantage of slavery is a path of eggshells. It\u2019s not an immediate process of complete overnight transformation. Like any psychological creation of destructive fashion, the idea of racial supremacy is like a virus that must be contained and delicately handled in order to hinder it\u2019s influence, as itself may never be completely destroyed once cast upon the earth. The black community appears to be in limbo or a purgatorial state as the glorification of ghetto violence induced by the lower-class, poverty stricken standards has been thrust into pop-culture. I agree with the black supremacists insofar as the view that the urban black youths need to be impowered and positively influenced so as not to submit to the temptation of the easy way out of their situation(or the situation imposed on them by the white devil, as you would see it, which, I suppose, is partially true, at least without the \u201cdevil\u201d part) and to have a positive influence upon the impowering of their own community. Also, take a look at the population ratio between white people and black people in this country when you decide to ridicule it\u2019s \u201cwhite\u201d infastructure. 75% of the population of the United States is white while 14% is made up of blacks. I use this statistic to show the representation of the country in it\u2019s own governmental system. Of course there will be a majority of white people within it. And all this to be said while a half-black half-white president resides in office! Now, the pineal gland calcification theory perpetuated by black supremacists is only partially correct, if actually valid at all. The calcification of the pineal gland is a reversable process that occurs over a period of time; white people aren\u2019t born with calcified pineal glands. And calcification obviously doesn\u2019t completely inhibit the pineal gland from functioning, for if the pineal gland itself were somehow \u201cdead\u201d then the human in question would not be able to function whatsoever. Calcification, on a large scale, reduces, not eliminates, the flow of melatonin. Pineal gland calcification is an extremely general occurence and only highly calcified pineal glands result in actual deficiencies. Now, white people may very well be more succeptable to pineal gland calcification than black people, although I will take that specific part of the theory with a grain of salt as I have only seen this advocated by black supremacists. And really, the classification of homo sapiens by the category of race is absolutely biologically absurd. Technically, there is no such thing as a biological seperate set of races of homo sapien, it\u2019s a strictly cultural division. Your beliefs are only justified through a religion, which pontentially anything could be justified from. A religion of the persecution and hatred from which it spawned. If humans survive on this earth long enough to intellectually evolve they will look upon the entire institution of race and religion with sorrow and remorse.\nI mean, I don\u2019t wish to tell you how to run your blog, but suppose you added a title to possibly get folk\u2019s attention?\nsee how they write article titles to grab people interested.\nabout what you\u2019ve written. Just my opinion, it could make your website a little bit more interesting.\nWhy are u attempting to be smart for?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The information is evident.\nI came to learn about the pineal gland but jealous white people had to destroy the topic with their 2 pence added.\n Completely beligerant and educated, as all racists are. Do you even care to research the history of slavery. Or how many free blacks owned slaves In america? How many white devils gave their lives fighting for your freedom against their own families..when white slaves were owned by blacks they didn\u2019t get freed, they got murdered. White guilt is over. Keep blaming the white devil for your ignorance. I guess it\u2019s easier than accepting that you\u2019re a failure all on your own\u2026only the stupidest..and hateful of every race are racist.\nAs an African America, or more so a \u201cHUMAN\u201d I find it hilarious how Black Supremacist groups are toxifying our youth with scientific illiteracy, psuedoscience backed by very uncredible sources, and using fear and bigotry as a way of keeping each other back; the crab in a bucket mentality.\nAll this hate is doing is lining the pockets of the puppet masters behind you, like Farakkhan.\nmy focus on career, education, and self-progress.\nI am truly disgusted with how we\u2019re taking religion, race, and fear and using it against each other.\nYou\u2019re more likely to go harm your own brother, than someone of another race, because when you hear the words \u201cWHITE SUPREMACY\u201d you truly feel inferior.\nI\u2019m a young Multi-racial women. I am mixed with black. Is the \u201cP Gland\u201d in interacial people strong or\u2026?\n", "prompt": "A rare vortex is now opened between Divinity and the mind of the black man, according to prophets in The Circle of Elijah, a prophetic order within Master Jesus Nigaros\u2019 Nation of Light.\nThe Window of God Against The Devil, as it is referred to, is the result of the level of Ultraviolet Light reaching the earth passing the 33rd degree mark.\nThe mark marks the emergence where the opening of the doorway between the mind of the black man and the mind of The Divine can become one, again.\nWho\u2019s Sittin\u2019 On Tha\u2019 Right Hand Side Now, Bytch?\nThe vacant seat of God, which is located in the Pineal Gland of the brain of the black man, is capable of containing God again. We are connected to the umbiilical chord of God. The Devil is made from the dirt of the earth and breath of our nostrils. The secret Chamber of God contains the Ultraviolet Light that is in the Pineal Gland of the black & African man. The Pineal Gland of The Devil is calcified. God may only begin to enter His Chamber & take His seat when you look through your 3rd Eye. The 3rd Eye of The Devil is on the back of his money because it is his God.\nAnd according to the order at this, its emergence, Divinity, for a short span of time, is honoring evil whispers blacks utter (aloud but to themselves) against whites.\nThat disillusioned white man could have saved himself from this, the hour of his enslavement, by accepting love & refraining from reprobate thoughts.

There were no whites living in the holy lands at the time the holy books were written. Whites were cave dwellers , and they took the traditions and wrote themselves into history and tried to write us out, except they couldn\u2019t blast away (all) of the black faces on the statues and art in the tombs of Egypt and other places, that prove we were God\u2019s original people.(smile) Blacks have worked for hundreds of years in this country, and were denied everything we tried to have.  We are left depending on a wicked system to see us through, (the system of in God we trust) and the media put our face on this shit, like we brought all the guns and drugs into this country ourselves. War on drugs was really a war on the black man. A black person can\u2019t get a loan to start a business. What jobs there are, are not paying anything.College is so expensive, that your career is obsolete before you can pay the loan off. The banks did predatory lending practices on blacks and latinos so they can lose their homes, so what the hell are we to do? Your people created all this hate, and it has come back on you, because you put all blacks in the same category. You see one black person doing something and say that (all) blacks do it.  You\u2019re going to one day wake up, and be in bondage, and wonder what happened.\nBless you brother. Your knowledge is rich and your patience is beautiful.  I often wonder what good it does to cast such pearls before these swine, though. For, they are a) ignorant of it; b) reject it; or c) deny it. Yet such truths that you speak, must be said.\nOh you said that well!\nThe only negros around during biblical times were the \u201cbeasts of the field\u201d.\nBeasts of the field are seperate from farm animals etc\u2026 in that they could work closely and communicate with man. They could also communicate with god.\nNegros were put on this planet in africa sorta like a stockyard. They were put there for \u201cman\u201d to take and use.\nYour, negro, dna is just a tad off from human dna..you can walk and talk and mimic humans well but there are subtle differences to seperate you. That jutting jaw, the fact that you have no soul. The fact that you can read yet not understand gods word.\nWhen we used to go fishing in georgia we would always take a young negro boy with us..getting stuck out in those swamps sometimes the boat motor would get hung up in some dumbasses trot lines or would shear a pin on a cypress knee\u2026we would use a young negro boy to hop into the snake and alligator infested waters to untangle the mess or to help get the motor up and in a position where the prop could be cleared or the pin replaced.\nOn many occasions back in those swamps we would just leave the boy after repairing the motor and on some occasions when we didnt have need of his services any longer we would either put him out on a body of land or simply toss him over the side in the middle of the swamp.\nNever lost one bit of sleep over it because he was there to serve us\u2026.just an animal\u2026a beast and a souless one at that\u2026.\nA bit like leaving a dog or cat out there\u2026he could either find his way back home or become food for the swamp.\nSatan has just revealed himself. See how barbaric these people are? He just PROVED that he has no soul from what he just posted. Nothing in the animal kingdom is as low as the white man. (Show me one place in the bible, where it its alright to kill people, and show me where it says BLACK people were beasts of the field.That\u2019s YOUR interpretation) The Bible says that Ethiopia and Egypt were at their FULL MIGHT. And they were not beasts in anyone\u2019s field. Whites were not fit to even be in the field, that;s why they stayed in caves for years.\nThey call themselves civilized. They need to look up the word civil, and they would see that they are far from it, and hanging, raping, mamimg and burning is not civilized. There\u2019s a difference between civilizing people and colonizing them. yeah, they did a lot of colonizing, and they\u2019d go to church Sunday morning praising their god, and go nigga hanging that same night. There is no human in them. The bible tells us that there\u2019s a man who is \u201cdevoid of soul.\u201d This is why it\u2019s so easy for them to do things like hang and burn people, and still be able to sleep at night. All he\u2019s doing, is confirming what we knew all along. And if we are \u201cbeasts of the field\u201d, then no wonder whites are mad, because they have a lot of catching up to do.  They\u2019re white, and they still can\u2019t get over. So much for being superior, to let a\u201d beast\u201d pass you up like that. LOL ! LOL! LOL! LOL! LOL!\nAnd Yacub called the name of the place pineal: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\nThat is a very good telling discription of having an abnormal pineal gland. You things have no human feelings, you would do the same thing to a white if need be. Just like whites enslaved white, you have no human conscious.\nThis Afronazi BLack Supremacist perspective is no different from any white racism. Can\u2019t you see its this idea of duality that separating all of us as humans and creating more racism this whole us and them, us the victims and them the evil white man, listen we are all one and the same get over yourselves, yes some white colonists did some bad things hundreds of years ago, the time is now and we are all part of the same consciousness made of pure vibrating energy and to elevate our souls as a planet we need to work together not demonize others blaming them for our problems and not taking responsibility for our own fates.\nMy African and Non White brothers see in your hearts that we are all in the same and that we must work together with love as our intention and not get caught up in all this bs (belief systems) if your soul does not show you the way then maybe a triptamine or 2 will point you in the right direction.\nIn realising we are your dark side, when will you be prepared to let go of it and bask in the light?\n Why don\u2019t you all get together and do a mass suicide. Drink some poisoned grape kool-aid.\n \nHopefully that day will come sooner or later. \n\nMy skin is black upon me.\nTo the one who made the comment about whites keeping us alive.\n I want someone to show one instance where they\u2019re keeping us alive.  They\u2019re just jealous because their women want us, and to think that the people who did all these things to us are representing Christ!\n My God!\nHow easy a comment to refute!\n White donations to Africa, whites giving you every ample oppertunity to move forward, every unfair advantage.\nYou said white people took niggers into slavery? \nWe were in caves while you were prospering?  You were raping babies to cure aids and living in mudhuts while the white man was building beautiful civilizations.\n1) Why did the niggers sell each other as slaves?\nThe most dangerous thing to a black these days is another black.\n\nI have to say this. They didn\u2019t take the chains off our bodies until the mental chains were on tight. We were labeled a sin and taught self hatred for 400 years, and white supremacy reigned supreme.  The best kind of slave to have is one who thinks he\u2019s free. If you don\u2019t treat a person as human, they wont respond as human. If you don\u2019t believe it, treat some WHITE kids like that for ONE DAY, and you will have some mass murderers on your hands.\nThough he has access to the truth,Shattered Dreams, resoundingly embraces ignorance.\n The money that is donated to africa gets used to poison the ground and turn it into desert land, so blacks won\u2019t be able to plant and help themselves, like I said before. I guess whites didn\u2019t have anything to do with the slaves getting over here, whether they were sold to your people or not, They knew it was wrong.\nYou don\u2019t have to buy something just because someone is selling it. Any \u201cHistory\u201d you\u2019re reading was written back in the Jim Crow days, when they were dehumanizing black people, so you already know there would be nothing in our favor written in those \u201cLieBury\u201d books. Black people were living in mud huts because they were nomads, who were trying to escape the white man\u2019s evil rath. They would put scars on their daughters faces to make them undesirable to the white man (and his barbaric lust for black flesh), so they wouldn\u2019t get kidnapped and raped.\nThey knew if they tried to build a city and stay in one place, they would be killed.  \nI am black, but comely.\nRondeux,agreed with your comment,WHO also introduced hiv to the gay community in sanfrancisco. Wonder what the swine flu vac has in mind?  \nDamn! Let these despicable, delusional, psychotic cavemen have it Rondeux.\nBlacks enslave Blacks in Africa, Muslims started the slave trade in Africa. Whites enslave whites and society has evolved to the point where this practice is only seen among tribes in underdeveloped nations. The colonists tried to enslave whites such as the Irish but they could easily escape and blend into the population. Africans could easily be identified and it was harder for them to get together and plan escapes because most of them came from different tribes which meant they had different languages so they couldn\u2019t communicate. They only reason slavery existed was economical not to be supreme among another race. The racism began only when the colonist tried to justify slavery so they wouldn\u2019t lose their workers. But the very nature of slavery in any form is evil so any justification was empty rhetoric intended to distract from the truth.\n\nWhen compared to the estimated 50 million Blacks taken from America and the generations of those born into \u2013 not to mention the racism that has continued to terrorize our lives since, your 3800 should be embarrassing to mention.\nits not about comparison. i was trying to make a point about the society of the time. so I don\u2019t feel embarrassed for my remark. I appreciate the passion though.\nYes, even during slavery the majority of black slaves killed were by other slaves usually over a woman or some petty disagreement.\nThe stories you here of white slavemasters treating their slaves in some sort of inhumane manner is just preposturous.\nSlaves were property that were bought and pain for. They cost money to upkeep and maintain.\nThey were basically the farm machinery of the day and no farmer is going to just destroy or harm a tractor or piece of equipment for no reason because it would be like costing himself good money.\nThere had been a lot of revisionist history written since slavery times. Lot of just downright lies written in order to make it look like the slaves were unduly treated.\nYes, slavery was wrong but those slaves were very well taken care of. Well fed, housed, clothed and given good medical treatment.\nIm sure there were some slave owners who might not have looked after their slaves as well as one should but there are people today who dont maintain their vehicles and equipment as well as the majority of people do.\nSlaves were much better off than a lot of poor white folks who by the way were unable to find good farm work because of the slaves.\nSlaves weren\u2019t freed either, they were fired. The incompetent niggers could not do the job.\nThey are now property of the United States government.\nLOL at the Rawanda niggers using children for human sacrifice. \n  Not one.\nIf you talk to many of the older negros out there you will find that none of them remember any lynchings.\nOut of 100 years there might have been a dozen or so actual lynchings of blacks. Black revisionist historians and white apologists have made the number seem much higher.\nEven after the civil war the crimes committed against negros were rare. Most of the deaths of negros have been by negros themselves.\nRosewood,Greenwood,Watts\u2026 these were riots caused by negros and the situations were aggravated by negro behavior\u2026.with the negro neighborhoods being burned down by the very negros who lived there.\nFirst thing a negro does when in an agitated state is he starts destroying all he has built.. he will burn his own homes and businesses down to the ground and then blame it all on the white man.\n\nWhen compared against the slave empire and legacy of hate and superiority your reprobate forefathers left you, that all you have is silly, little nonsensical naratives is comical.\nWhat happened? Is that all you got? Your forefathers are rolling in their graves.\nTell us all more stories!\nGeorgia Cracker uses factual information between his stories.\nYou do not, you have yet to refute one of his excellent points, you subhuman virus.\nYou fake scoundrel! What\u2019s going on? This isn\u2019t about your fake history. It\u2019s about your calcified Pineal Gland and the end of your world.\nWhile I don\u2019t think I was trying to make the point you\u2019re referencing, I suppose it might apply as well.\nThat doesn\u2019t make the slightest bit of sense. I have no idea what you\u2019re trying to say, but I bet you love me because I\u2019m the only person who gives you any attention.\nI do so because you\u2019re way too much fun.  I bet you really slaughter yo\u2019homies on the downlow, or is more like \u201cslather\u201d on the downlow. mmm? buttercakes?\noop\u2019s I posted in the wrong place.. apologize, Shattered Dreams that comment was meant for the goofy nigger slug-downlow-hter leadfoot.\n\nRespectfully, your skin and faculties are too week to endure the hardships of toil underneath the sun.\nIOWs, plans for what you will spend your time doing have already been made.\nMuslims started the slave trade in Africa, not the white man. So does that make Muslims less than slaves?\nThe first Africans who went into slavery were kidnapped, not traded. While slavery existed in Africa, the form of slavery Caucasians inflicted upon our ancestors (Chattel slavery) hadn\u2019t been previously recorded in history. IOWs, in no other instances where men were slaves had then been stripped of their identity, religion and humanity.\nYou\u2019re right, in any where else in the world a slave could \u201cearn,\u201d their freedom.\nAnd they weren\u2019t treated like commodities.\nWhere does it say that the colonialists from England(not \u201cCaucasians\u201d, but one specific group of white people; I happen to be white and my ancestors were Russian, Irish and Native American and had nothing to do with the Atlantic slave trade) were the only ones to enforce Chattel slavery? The Arabics enslaved a far larger number of Africans and their slave trade lasted far longer(as the Atlantic slave trade was just an offshoot of the Arabic slave trade). Not only that, but the slavery of Africans by Arabics continues in modern northern Africa dispite slavery having been banned there 1981 and criminalized in 2007(as opposed to 1865). Does that make any difference at all? You hate the white man from taking you away from your culture while simultaneously adopting the religion(or a mutation of it) of the Arabs who started the system that brought it on in the first place AND (some)continue to do it. How ironic is it that those radical black muslims talk about the Stockholm Syndrome when referring to \u201chouse niggers\u201d? Ha, maybe if you refuse to see the whole picture. No wonder there\u2019s still an obssession with slavery by African Americans, it\u2019s engrained in your culture. Slavery between Africans was prevelant for years before the Arabs and Europeans ever set foot in Africa, and it is present to this day.  A human is as corruptable as any other. And from someone who had seen the products of the Arabic slave trade: \u201c\u2026We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed through the body and lying on the path. [Onlookers] said an Arab who passed early that morning had done it in anger at losing the price he had given for her, because she was unable to walk any longer. We passed a woman tied by the neck to a tree and dead\u2026\u201d, yeah, that doesn\u2019t sound like Chattel slavery at all. That doesn\u2019t sound as if they were treated like commodities, does it? Even if, as you said, the European colonialists were the first to use Chattel slavery, do the actions of that one specific group in history condone absolute condemnation over the entire race which that group was a member of? I suppose that\u2019s were religious justification comes in, doesn\u2019t it? The fact that the slaves were stripped of their humanity is commentary on the nature of slavery in the country itself. It was/is a capitalistic society that used slavery as a means of economic stability; in the beginning(the important point) it had nothing to do with notions of racial supremacy. There were actually small numbers of enslaved whites(and I\u2019m not talking about endentured servatude). Emotional and psychological justification of the institution of slavery as a means of economic upwelling came in the form of reducing those enslaved to a form of life only fit for slavery, sort of like how the fanatically religious black supremacist justifies his hateful and bigoted views brought on as a backlash against racism by placing the fault of all negativity in the life of a black man on the white man and using heavily distorted scientific fact as a means to support those views and sleep at night. \nThe concept of white supremacy benefitted whites world wide.\nThe idea of white supremacy theoretically benefits whites world-wide, but how many white cultures do you see actively accepting that as an objective system? You cannot hate all whites for the formation of a single social policy regarding the justification of the horrid acts of slavery under the guise of it being a form of economic output by a single specific group of white people simply because it refers to all white people. The concept of black supremacy benefits all blacks, yet I know there are quite a few black people who violently rebuke those teachings and hold themselves completely outside of it. White people at large certainly aren\u2019t attempting to actively destroy African culture. The \u201cwhite\u201d history book teaches the history of the United States with all it\u2019s faults and failings and brutality as well as it\u2019s triumphs. Personally, I\u2019m fascinated by most cultural traditions, including African, which hold influence on my own life. There\u2019s no grounds on eliminating the cultural heritage of any \u201crace\u201d in the progression of a nation, especially the U.S. To look at the United States as a faction of white supremacy is to leave many, many factors unaccounted for. You already understand her history of turmoil and struggle. Apply this to modern times. The assimilation of black people from a psychological level of what they were reduced to by the early southern colonialists who took economic advantage of slavery is a path of eggshells. It\u2019s not an immediate process of complete overnight transformation. Like any psychological creation of destructive fashion, the idea of racial supremacy is like a virus that must be contained and delicately handled in order to hinder it\u2019s influence, as itself may never be completely destroyed once cast upon the earth. The black community appears to be in limbo or a purgatorial state as the glorification of ghetto violence induced by the lower-class, poverty stricken standards has been thrust into pop-culture. I agree with the black supremacists insofar as the view that the urban black youths need to be impowered and positively influenced so as not to submit to the temptation of the easy way out of their situation(or the situation imposed on them by the white devil, as you would see it, which, I suppose, is partially true, at least without the \u201cdevil\u201d part) and to have a positive influence upon the impowering of their own community. Also, take a look at the population ratio between white people and black people in this country when you decide to ridicule it\u2019s \u201cwhite\u201d infastructure. 75% of the population of the United States is white while 14% is made up of blacks. I use this statistic to show the representation of the country in it\u2019s own governmental system. Of course there will be a majority of white people within it. And all this to be said while a half-black half-white president resides in office! Now, the pineal gland calcification theory perpetuated by black supremacists is only partially correct, if actually valid at all. The calcification of the pineal gland is a reversable process that occurs over a period of time; white people aren\u2019t born with calcified pineal glands. And calcification obviously doesn\u2019t completely inhibit the pineal gland from functioning, for if the pineal gland itself were somehow \u201cdead\u201d then the human in question would not be able to function whatsoever. Calcification, on a large scale, reduces, not eliminates, the flow of melatonin. Pineal gland calcification is an extremely general occurence and only highly calcified pineal glands result in actual deficiencies. Now, white people may very well be more succeptable to pineal gland calcification than black people, although I will take that specific part of the theory with a grain of salt as I have only seen this advocated by black supremacists. And really, the classification of homo sapiens by the category of race is absolutely biologically absurd. Technically, there is no such thing as a biological seperate set of races of homo sapien, it\u2019s a strictly cultural division. Your beliefs are only justified through a religion, which pontentially anything could be justified from. A religion of the persecution and hatred from which it spawned. If humans survive on this earth long enough to intellectually evolve they will look upon the entire institution of race and religion with sorrow and remorse.\nI mean, I don\u2019t wish to tell you how to run your blog, but suppose you added a title to possibly get folk\u2019s attention?\nsee how they write article titles to grab people interested.\nabout what you\u2019ve written.

Do you even care to research the history of slavery. Or how many free blacks owned slaves In america? How many white devils gave their lives fighting for your freedom against their own families..when white slaves were owned by blacks they didn\u2019t get freed, they got murdered. White guilt is over. Keep blaming the white devil for your ignorance. I guess it\u2019s easier than accepting that you\u2019re a failure all on your own\u2026only the stupidest..and hateful of every race are racist.\nAs an African America, or more so a \u201cHUMAN\u201d I find it hilarious how Black Supremacist groups are toxifying our youth with scientific illiteracy, psuedoscience backed by very uncredible sources, and using fear and bigotry as a way of keeping each other back; the crab in a bucket mentality.\nAll this hate is doing is lining the pockets of the puppet masters behind you, like Farakkhan.\nmy focus on career, education, and self-progress.\nI am truly disgusted with how we\u2019re taking religion, race, and fear and using it against each other.\nYou\u2019re more likely to go harm your own brother, than someone of another race, because when you hear the words \u201cWHITE SUPREMACY\u201d you truly feel inferior.\nI\u2019m a young Multi-racial women.

We are left depending on a wicked system to see us through, (the system of in God we trust) and the media put our face on this shit, like we brought all the guns and drugs into this country ourselves. War on drugs was really a war on the black man. A black person can\u2019t get a loan to start a business.

The bible tells us that there\u2019s a man who is \u201cdevoid of soul.\u201d This is why it\u2019s so easy for them to do things like hang and burn people, and still be able to sleep at night. All he\u2019s doing, is confirming what we knew all along. And if we are \u201cbeasts of the field\u201d, then no wonder whites are mad, because they have a lot of catching up to do.  They\u2019re white, and they still can\u2019t get over. So much for being superior, to let a\u201d beast\u201d pass you up like that. LOL ! LOL! LOL! LOL! LOL!\nAnd Yacub called the name of the place pineal: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\nThat is a very good telling discription of having an abnormal pineal gland. You things have no human feelings, you would do the same thing to a white if need be. Just like whites enslaved white, you have no human conscious.\nThis Afronazi BLack Supremacist perspective is no different from any white racism. Can\u2019t you see its this idea of duality that separating all of us as humans and creating more racism this whole us and them, us the victims and them the evil white man, listen we are all one and the same get over yourselves, yes some white colonists did some bad things hundreds of years ago, the time is now and we are all part of the same consciousness made of pure vibrating energy and to elevate our souls as a planet we need to work together not demonize others blaming them for our problems and not taking responsibility for our own fates.\nMy African and Non White brothers see in your hearts that we are all in the same and that we must work together with love as our intention and not get caught up in all this bs (belief systems) if your soul does not show you the way then maybe a triptamine or 2 will point you in the right direction.\nIn realising we are your dark side, when will you be prepared to let go of it and bask in the light?\n Why don\u2019t you all get together and do a mass suicide. Drink some poisoned grape kool-aid.\n \nHopefully that day will come sooner or later. \n\nMy skin is black upon me.\nTo the one who made the comment about whites keeping us alive.\n I want someone to show one instance where they\u2019re keeping us alive.  They\u2019re just jealous because their women want us, and to think that the people who did all these things to us are representing Christ!\n My God!\nHow easy a comment to refute!\n White donations to Africa, whites giving you every ample oppertunity to move forward, every unfair advantage.\nYou said white people took niggers into slavery? \nWe were in caves while you were prospering?  You were raping babies to cure aids and living in mudhuts while the white man was building beautiful civilizations.\n1) Why did the niggers sell each other as slaves?\nThe most dangerous thing to a black these days is another black.\n\nI have to say this. They didn\u2019t take the chains off our bodies until the mental chains were on tight. We were labeled a sin and taught self hatred for 400 years, and white supremacy reigned supreme.  The best kind of slave to have is one who thinks he\u2019s free. If you don\u2019t treat a person as human, they wont respond as human. If you don\u2019t believe it, treat some WHITE kids like that for ONE DAY, and you will have some mass murderers on your hands.\nThough he has access to the truth,Shattered Dreams, resoundingly embraces ignorance.\n The money that is donated to africa gets used to poison the ground and turn it into desert land, so blacks won\u2019t be able to plant and help themselves, like I said before. I guess whites didn\u2019t have anything to do with the slaves getting over here, whether they were sold to your people or not, They knew it was wrong.\nYou don\u2019t have to buy something just because someone is selling it. Any \u201cHistory\u201d you\u2019re reading was written back in the Jim Crow days, when they were dehumanizing black people, so you already know there would be nothing in our favor written in those \u201cLieBury\u201d books. Black people were living in mud huts because they were nomads, who were trying to escape the white man\u2019s evil rath. They would put scars on their daughters faces to make them undesirable to the white man (and his barbaric lust for black flesh), so they wouldn\u2019t get kidnapped and raped.\nThey knew if they tried to build a city and stay in one place, they would be killed.  \nI am black, but comely.\nRondeux,agreed with your comment,WHO also introduced hiv to the gay community in sanfrancisco. Wonder what the swine flu vac has in mind?  \nDamn! Let these despicable, delusional, psychotic cavemen have it Rondeux.\nBlacks enslave Blacks in Africa, Muslims started the slave trade in Africa. Whites enslave whites and society has evolved to the point where this practice is only seen among tribes in underdeveloped nations. The colonists tried to enslave whites such as the Irish but they could easily escape and blend into the population. Africans could easily be identified and it was harder for them to get together and plan escapes because most of them came from different tribes which meant they had different languages so they couldn\u2019t communicate. They only reason slavery existed was economical not to be supreme among another race. The racism began only when the colonist tried to justify slavery so they wouldn\u2019t lose their workers. But the very nature of slavery in any form is evil so any justification was empty rhetoric intended to distract from the truth.\n\nWhen compared to the estimated 50 million Blacks taken from America and the generations of those born into \u2013 not to mention the racism that has continued to terrorize our lives since, your 3800 should be embarrassing to mention.\nits not about comparison. i was trying to make a point about the society of the time. so I don\u2019t feel embarrassed for my remark. I appreciate the passion though.\nYes, even during slavery the majority of black slaves killed were by other slaves usually over a woman or some petty disagreement.\nThe stories you here of white slavemasters treating their slaves in some sort of inhumane manner is just preposturous.\nSlaves were property that were bought and pain for. They cost money to upkeep and maintain.\nThey were basically the farm machinery of the day and no farmer is going to just destroy or harm a tractor or piece of equipment for no reason because it would be like costing himself good money.\nThere had been a lot of revisionist history written since slavery times. Lot of just downright lies written in order to make it look like the slaves were unduly treated.\nYes, slavery was wrong but those slaves were very well taken care of. Well fed, housed, clothed and given good medical treatment.\nIm sure there were some slave owners who might not have looked after their slaves as well as one should but there are people today who dont maintain their vehicles and equipment as well as the majority of people do.\nSlaves were much better off than a lot of poor white folks who by the way were unable to find good farm work because of the slaves.\nSlaves weren\u2019t freed either, they were fired. The incompetent niggers could not do the job.\nThey are now property of the United States government.\nLOL at the Rawanda niggers using children for human sacrifice. \n  Not one.\nIf you talk to many of the older negros out there you will find that none of them remember any lynchings.\nOut of 100 years there might have been a dozen or so actual lynchings of blacks. Black revisionist historians and white apologists have made the number seem much higher.\nEven after the civil war the crimes committed against negros were rare. Most of the deaths of negros have been by negros themselves.\nRosewood,Greenwood,Watts\u2026 these were riots caused by negros and the situations were aggravated by negro behavior\u2026.with the negro neighborhoods being burned down by the very negros who lived there.\nFirst thing a negro does when in an agitated state is he starts destroying all he has built.. he will burn his own homes and businesses down to the ground and then blame it all on the white man.\n\nWhen compared against the slave empire and legacy of hate and superiority your reprobate forefathers left you, that all you have is silly, little nonsensical naratives is comical.\nWhat happened? Is that all you got? Your forefathers are rolling in their graves.\nTell us all more stories!\nGeorgia Cracker uses factual information between his stories.\nYou do not, you have yet to refute one of his excellent points, you subhuman virus.\nYou fake scoundrel! What\u2019s going on? This isn\u2019t about your fake history. It\u2019s about your calcified Pineal Gland and the end of your world.\nWhile I don\u2019t think I was trying to make the point you\u2019re referencing, I suppose it might apply as well.\nThat doesn\u2019t make the slightest bit of sense. I have no idea what you\u2019re trying to say, but I bet you love me because I\u2019m the only person who gives you any attention.\nI do so because you\u2019re way too much fun.  I bet you really slaughter yo\u2019homies on the downlow, or is more like \u201cslather\u201d on the downlow. mmm? buttercakes?\noop\u2019s I posted in the wrong place.. apologize, Shattered Dreams that comment was meant for the goofy nigger slug-downlow-hter leadfoot.\n\nRespectfully, your skin and faculties are too week to endure the hardships of toil underneath the sun.\nIOWs, plans for what you will spend your time doing have already been made.\nMuslims started the slave trade in Africa, not the white man. So does that make Muslims less than slaves?\nThe first Africans who went into slavery were kidnapped, not traded. While slavery existed in Africa, the form of slavery Caucasians inflicted upon our ancestors (Chattel slavery) hadn\u2019t been previously recorded in history. IOWs, in no other instances where men were slaves had then been stripped of their identity, religion and humanity.\nYou\u2019re right, in any where else in the world a slave could \u201cearn,\u201d their freedom.\nAnd they weren\u2019t treated like commodities.\nWhere does it say that the colonialists from England(not \u201cCaucasians\u201d, but one specific group of white people; I happen to be white and my ancestors were Russian, Irish and Native American and had nothing to do with the Atlantic slave trade) were the only ones to enforce Chattel slavery? The Arabics enslaved a far larger number of Africans and their slave trade lasted far longer(as the Atlantic slave trade was just an offshoot of the Arabic slave trade). Not only that, but the slavery of Africans by Arabics continues in modern northern Africa dispite slavery having been banned there 1981 and criminalized in 2007(as opposed to 1865). Does that make any difference at all? You hate the white man from taking you away from your culture while simultaneously adopting the religion(or a mutation of it) of the Arabs who started the system that brought it on in the first place AND (some)continue to do it. How ironic is it that those radical black muslims talk about the Stockholm Syndrome when referring to \u201chouse niggers\u201d? Ha, maybe if you refuse to see the whole picture. No wonder there\u2019s still an obssession with slavery by African Americans, it\u2019s engrained in your culture. Slavery between Africans was prevelant for years before the Arabs and Europeans ever set foot in Africa, and it is present to this day.  A human is as corruptable as any other. And from someone who had seen the products of the Arabic slave trade: \u201c\u2026We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed through the body and lying on the path. [Onlookers] said an Arab who passed early that morning had done it in anger at losing the price he had given for her, because she was unable to walk any longer. We passed a woman tied by the neck to a tree and dead\u2026\u201d, yeah, that doesn\u2019t sound like Chattel slavery at all. That doesn\u2019t sound as if they were treated like commodities, does it? Even if, as you said, the European colonialists were the first to use Chattel slavery, do the actions of that one specific group in history condone absolute condemnation over the entire race which that group was a member of? I suppose that\u2019s were religious justification comes in, doesn\u2019t it? The fact that the slaves were stripped of their humanity is commentary on the nature of slavery in the country itself. It was/is a capitalistic society that used slavery as a means of economic stability; in the beginning(the important point) it had nothing to do with notions of racial supremacy. There were actually small numbers of enslaved whites(and I\u2019m not talking about endentured servatude). Emotional and psychological justification of the institution of slavery as a means of economic upwelling came in the form of reducing those enslaved to a form of life only fit for slavery, sort of like how the fanatically religious black supremacist justifies his hateful and bigoted views brought on as a backlash against racism by placing the fault of all negativity in the life of a black man on the white man and using heavily distorted scientific fact as a means to support those views and sleep at night. \nThe concept of white supremacy benefitted whites world wide.\nThe idea of white supremacy theoretically benefits whites world-wide, but how many white cultures do you see actively accepting that as an objective system? You cannot hate all whites for the formation of a single social policy regarding the justification of the horrid acts of slavery under the guise of it being a form of economic output by a single specific group of white people simply because it refers to all white people. The concept of black supremacy benefits all blacks, yet I know there are quite a few black people who violently rebuke those teachings and hold themselves completely outside of it. White people at large certainly aren\u2019t attempting to actively destroy African culture. The \u201cwhite\u201d history book teaches the history of the United States with all it\u2019s faults and failings and brutality as well as it\u2019s triumphs. Personally, I\u2019m fascinated by most cultural traditions, including African, which hold influence on my own life. There\u2019s no grounds on eliminating the cultural heritage of any \u201crace\u201d in the progression of a nation, especially the U.S. To look at the United States as a faction of white supremacy is to leave many, many factors unaccounted for. You already understand her history of turmoil and struggle. Apply this to modern times. The assimilation of black people from a psychological level of what they were reduced to by the early southern colonialists who took economic advantage of slavery is a path of eggshells. It\u2019s not an immediate process of complete overnight transformation. Like any psychological creation of destructive fashion, the idea of racial supremacy is like a virus that must be contained and delicately handled in order to hinder it\u2019s influence, as itself may never be completely destroyed once cast upon the earth. The black community appears to be in limbo or a purgatorial state as the glorification of ghetto violence induced by the lower-class, poverty stricken standards has been thrust into pop-culture. I agree with the black supremacists insofar as the view that the urban black youths need to be impowered and positively influenced so as not to submit to the temptation of the easy way out of their situation(or the situation imposed on them by the white devil, as you would see it, which, I suppose, is partially true, at least without the \u201cdevil\u201d part) and to have a positive influence upon the impowering of their own community. Also, take a look at the population ratio between white people and black people in this country when you decide to ridicule it\u2019s \u201cwhite\u201d infastructure. 75% of the population of the United States is white while 14% is made up of blacks. I use this statistic to show the representation of the country in it\u2019s own governmental system. Of course there will be a majority of white people within it. And all this to be said while a half-black half-white president resides in office! Now, the pineal gland calcification theory perpetuated by black supremacists is only partially correct, if actually valid at all. The calcification of the pineal gland is a reversable process that occurs over a period of time; white people aren\u2019t born with calcified pineal glands. And calcification obviously doesn\u2019t completely inhibit the pineal gland from functioning, for if the pineal gland itself were somehow \u201cdead\u201d then the human in question would not be able to function whatsoever. Calcification, on a large scale, reduces, not eliminates, the flow of melatonin. Pineal gland calcification is an extremely general occurence and only highly calcified pineal glands result in actual deficiencies. Now, white people may very well be more succeptable to pineal gland calcification than black people, although I will take that specific part of the theory with a grain of salt as I have only seen this advocated by black supremacists. And really, the classification of homo sapiens by the category of race is absolutely biologically absurd. Technically, there is no such thing as a biological seperate set of races of homo sapien, it\u2019s a strictly cultural division. Your beliefs are only justified through a religion, which pontentially anything could be justified from. A religion of the persecution and hatred from which it spawned. If humans survive on this earth long enough to intellectually evolve they will look upon the entire institution of race and religion with sorrow and remorse.\nI mean, I don\u2019t wish to tell you how to run your blog, but suppose you added a title to possibly get folk\u2019s attention?\nsee how they write article titles to grab people interested.\nabout what you\u2019ve written.

The information is evident.\nI came to learn about the pineal gland but jealous white people had to destroy the topic with their 2 pence added.\n Completely beligerant and educated, as all racists are. Do you even care to research the history of slavery. Or how many free blacks owned slaves In america? How many white devils gave their lives fighting for your freedom against their own families..when white slaves were owned by blacks they didn\u2019t get freed, they got murdered. White guilt is over. Keep blaming the white devil for your ignorance. I guess it\u2019s easier than accepting that you\u2019re a failure all on your own\u2026only the stupidest..and hateful of every race are racist.\nAs an African America, or more so a \u201cHUMAN\u201d I find it hilarious how Black Supremacist groups are toxifying our youth with scientific illiteracy, psuedoscience backed by very uncredible sources, and using fear and bigotry as a way of keeping each other back; the crab in a bucket mentality.\nAll this hate is doing is lining the pockets of the puppet masters behind you, like Farakkhan.\nmy focus on career, education, and self-progress.\nI am truly disgusted with how we\u2019re taking religion, race, and fear and using it against each other.\nYou\u2019re more likely to go harm your own brother, than someone of another race, because when you hear the words \u201cWHITE SUPREMACY\u201d you truly feel inferior.\nI\u2019m a young Multi-racial women.

{"random_doc_file_path": "/home/eisape/projects/diversify_lm_output/dolma/data/v1_5r2_sample-0017.json.gz", "random_doc": "Sociopathy is a term that essentially disappeared from the DSM all the way back in 1980, when, along with psychopathy, it was replaced by Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). However somehow it managed to remain a fixture in the popular lexicon. I suspect that\u2019s in part because the word antisocial calls up images of someone who goes out of their way to avoid other people, and that\u2019s not at all what the ASPD diagnosis is all about.\nI confess this startled me. How many people do you know who would identify themselves in public as sociopathic, especially in the context of their own marriage? \nSo I admit I wondered if it was for real.\nThen again, the author does identify herself, and she is apparently a licensed psychologist, so we have to assume she knows what she\u2019s doing. And the fact is, many of the clients I\u2019ve worked with had at one point or another been labeled sociopathic, since substance disorders, in particular alcoholism, often appear alongside ASPD. It\u2019s almost a rule rather than an exception.\nSociopathic people can be quite perceptive about others\u2019 desires and motivations\u2013 it\u2019s a key to manipulating them\u2013 but self-awareness is not their strong suit. In fact, I can\u2019t picture one of our ASPD clients composing an article like this one. It requires insight they do not ordinarily possess.\nUnless there was a hidden agenda\u2026 no, forget I said that.\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. On a spectrum from mild to severe, I assume the writer is on the lower end.

There are various types of artificial neural networks, and we will discuss them in detail in later chapters.

We will then discuss how to train a perceptron using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the training loss. SGD is a popular algorithm for training deep neural networks, which is also known as backpropagation. SGD works by repeatedly updating the weights and biases of the neural network according to the gradients of the training loss with respect to the weights and biases, using random sampling. In other words, SGD tries to find the direction that decreases the training loss fastest, and iteratively takes steps in that direction until it converges. In this chapter, we will discuss how to implement SGD for training a perceptron in Python using TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning library.

It has improved image classification, object detection, face detection, etc. Object detection using deep learning has become a very popular topic in recent years. Object detection is a challenging task as compared to classification problems because the image can contain multiple instances of the same object and also because the class label must be mapped to every pixel in the image. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been proved to be very effective in object detection task. An interesting CNN based object detection architecture is YOLOv3. It is an advanced version of Faster R-CNN. YOLOv3 has the ability to detect multiple objects with high accuracy and less latency. It is a Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD). A SSd architecture is designed with the idea of reducing the computation time by using a single neural network architecture to detect different objects. It achieves real-time inference without compromising the accuracy. The paper gives a detailed explanation of this architecture. YOLOv3 can run on Android smartphone, it is compatible with various datasets and can be used to detect faces as well. Face detection can be used for various applications such as biometric security system, surveillance, etc. This research project deals with face detection using the YOLOv3 object detection algorithm. 2. Face Recognition with FaceNetThis is a research project for implementation of FaceNet with CNN. Face recognition and face detection are two main applications of CNN algorithms. FaceNet is a deep learning algorithm that performs face recognition. It has won the ILSVRC competition in 2014. It is an end-to-end deep learning architecture that uses CNN to identify a face in the input image and then perform face verification. The face identification is based on the Fisher Vector (FV). Fisher vector is a way to reduce the dimension of an image while still preserving the most important features. The face recognition system is designed to achieve a high level of accuracy. This research project involves implementation of FaceNet algorithm for the face recognition application in various fields. 3. Multi-modal Face RecognitionThe aim of this research project is to develop a multi-modal deep learning based face recognition system. The algorithm should be able to use the images from the two modalities for face recognition purposes. One modalities is RGB image, the other modalities is depth images. Multi-modal image features are extracted from RGB and depth images respectively", "completion_only": "3D Face detection in an Image using YOLOv3Deep learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision.

I am not banning fracking. No matter how many times Donald Trump lies about me.\"\nBut that is far from what he was saying earlier this year.

I'm talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet -- no ifs, buts and maybes about it.\"\nAfter that famous Biden-Sanders debate, the Biden campaign issued a retraction, meaning this isn't really what the former vice president meant to say. And, admittedly, he's old; he loses his train of thought; he can't be expected to remember his latest official position on fracking every week. His latest flip and flop is no drilling permits on federal lands.\nBut what is unambiguous and in big, bold writing in the Biden \"buy America\" plan is his signature pledge to the climate change crusaders to end fossil fuel use in America by 2035. This, of course, is a de facto ban on fracking, because if we aren't going to use the energy, why would anyone drill for it?\nThat Biden zero-carbon emissions target requires a glide path to no fossil fuel production and consumption 15 years from now. Given that we currently get about 80% of our energy from oil, gas and coal, according to Daniel Yergin, a world expert on energy, getting down to zero is going to be a gut-wrenching experience for blue-collar workers.\nThere are a lot of them. The oil, gas and coal industry accounts for somewhere between 5 and 10 million jobs, depending on how you count them. These are almost all high-paying blue-collar jobs -- the kind that Biden laughingly says he wants to bring back home to America -- and hundreds of thousands of them are in battleground states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Colorado. How the left ever thinks it will turn Texas blue by promising to ban oil is one of life's great mysteries. \nThe Wall Street Journal reports that, in 2019, the U.S. led the world in oil and gas production. Because of fracking, we passed Saudi Arabia in output. In other words, oil and gas IS made in America now, thanks, in no small part, to President Donald Trump's all-in strategy of making the USA energy dominant.\nSo, Biden is telling us we are going to bring jobs back home by decapitation our energy industry. Wind and solar account for about 5% of our energy consumption today, so even if we double their output, we still need to have access to other energy. Under the Biden plan, it sure looks like we will have to get it from Russia, Saudi Arabia and even China, which is planning to build hundreds of coal plants over the next decade.\nThe leaders of Beijing could care less about climate change.

Textual similarity\nThe paper focuses on the textual similarity, where the sentences are treated as vectors in a high dimensional space. In the experiment, we show that by simply comparing the high-dimensional vectors we can detect textual similarity much better than by using the bag-of-words approach.\n\nIn the experiment, we show that our approach is not sensitive to the length of the documents, while the bag-of-words approach degrades in performance on very long documents.\n2. 2. Multi-lingual textual similarity\nIn addition to the textual similarity, we also consider the multi-lingual similarity, where we compare the similarity between the documents of different languages. In the experiments, we use only German and English data, however, the developed approach can be easily generalized to more languages. Moreover, we only consider the German-English data, however, the approach is fully compatible with data from other languages, as long as they are compatible for the translation with Google translate.\n\nIn addition, we also compare the multi-lingual similarity with the multi-lingual similarity, where we perform the multi-lingual text translation.\n3. 3. Document comparison\nDocument comparison is a common task in the information retrieval. In the paper, we describe a number of experiments, where we compare the similarity of the documents written in German and English. The document comparison is more involved task than the textual similarity, because we have to also consider the structural differences between the documents.\n\nThe experiments show, that the document comparison is a highly non-linear task. We propose a method to reduce the non-linearity of the document comparison using a neural network, which was used in the text classification.\n4. 4. Word vector representation\nIn the experiments, we use a word vector representation of the words from the Google word2vec model. The word2vec model was trained on the Google News corpus, which contains several billion English documents. The model is not limited to the English language, as it can be easily used with data from any language.\n\nWe use the word2vec model, because we are not limited to the use of particular word embeddings. We also compare our method with the GloVe model, which was also trained on the Google News corpus, and the word2vec model trained on the movie scripts.\n5. 5.

Often, it is served with a lemon-butter sauce over pasta.\nBelow are the ingredients you\u2019ll need to make these delicious chicken Romano meatballs.\nThese chicken meatballs would be delicious over your favorite pasta or rice. You could also serve them on a hoagie roll to make a sandwich or with vegetables like roasted asparagus or grilled zucchini. Another idea is to pair the meatballs with a salad and a piece of crusty bread to soak up the sauce.\nUse ground turkey instead of ground chicken.\nSub parmesan for Romano.\nSwap out the dried oregano or basil for rosemary or thyme.\nOmit the crushed red pepper if you prefer mild food.\nIf you prefer to cook without wine, replace the wine with more broth.\nIn a bowl, combine the ground chicken with the garlic, egg, bread crumbs, cheese, parsley, dried basil, oregano, pepper flakes, salt and pepper.\nMix with clean hands until just combined - do not overmix.\nShape the mixture into meatballs that are 1-inch in size - or slightly less, about 24.\nHeat an oven-safe skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil.\nAdd the meatballs in a single layer (you may need to do this in batches), browning on all sides, cooking about 5 to 6 minutes in total. You don\u2019t need to cook them fully because we will put them in the oven - just brown them.\nIn the same skillet over medium heat, add the shallots and garlic with a pinch of salt and stir.\nCook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the white wine, scraping any brown bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.\nLet it simmer for 2 minutes. Add in the sliced lemons and chicken stock.\nAdd the meatballs back into the pan.\nBake for 15 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through to 165 degrees F.\nServe on sandwiches or with pasta, rice or your favorite vegetable.\nI loved these meatballs! Very flavourful and filling. I wasn\u2019t keen on the sauce though. Too thin in my opinion. These meatballs would be great with Marina sauce on top instead.\nI made these last night but ended up just simmering on the stove rather than turning on the oven (it\u2019s still hot here). Came out amazing. We also added pasta which soaked up the sauce. My daughter said it was a keeper!\nThese were awesome!

To buy and sell Dogecoin, you'll have to get a wallet. You also have to create an account with a crypto exchange. Coinbase has been one of the best choices for years, allowing you to convert traditional currency to cryptocurrencies for a low fee. The website is easy to use, and you can pay and send money through your email.\n\nHow To Buy Dogecoin\n\nIt's also worth noting that a recent study from Chainalysis found that 90 percent of all bitcoins and Dogecoins have been mined.

I will be paying you directly at $10 per hour. So to get $10 for the two parts, you must do each part in 1 hour. I am not a native speaker, so I would appreciate if you could speak in simple, clear English, so I can understand your words.If you have no experience in NLP, do not apply. If you have some experience, then do not apply if you cannot finish these two tasks within 1 hour per task. Please only apply if you have very good understanding of NLP concepts, and if you have been doing a research in NLP. Otherwise, if you do not finish these two tasks in a minute, then they are of no use to me. The project can be easily completed in 1 hour by someone with knowledge and practical experience. I will require two deliverables for each task:1. You must write in MS word, all ten tasks with brief description. Please just write them like a bulleted list of ten tasks with brief description. Each task will be 20-30 words in total. This will be the first part.2. Then you must write the description of each task in detail with 4-5 lines for each.
