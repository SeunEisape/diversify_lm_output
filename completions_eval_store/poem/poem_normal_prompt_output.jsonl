Some poetry is written to convey a particular message or idea to the reader, while other poetry is more about the beauty of the language or the sound of the words. Some poems are written to tell a story, while others are more abstract.\n\nThere is no right or wrong way to write a poem. You can use any style of poetry that you like, and you can write about any topic that you want to. The most important thing is that you express yourself through your poetry. There are many different types of poetry, such as free verse, haiku, limerick, sonnet, and narrative poems.\n\nYou can write a 250-word poem about anything you want. Write about your emotions, your dreams, your memories, or anything else that you want to write about.\n\nWhen you are writing poetry, it is important to use descriptive words and to use figurative language. Figurative language is when you use words to create an image or a picture in the reader's mind. For example, you might say \"the leaves were like yellow flames\" instead of saying \"the leaves were yellow.\" By using figurative language, you can make your poem more interesting and more vivid.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind when writing poetry is to use rhyme and rhythm. You don't have to rhyme every line of your poem, but it is a good idea to use some rhyme in your poem. Rhythm is the beat or rhythm of the poem. You can use words that have a hard sound (like \"cat\") or words that have a soft sound (like \"mother\").\n\nIf you need help writing poetry, you can read some poems that other people have written. This will give you ideas about what types of poetry you like and what kind of poetry you would like to write.\n\nPoetry is a wonderful way to express yourself.

Next we are going to do the pattern love, fire, wind. Write the poem again with these words at the end of the stanza. Notice how these words now change the meaning of the poem.

{"prompt": "Write a 250-word poem:", "full_output": "Write a 250-word poem: Write about a topic, then remove any reference to it in the final line. The last line should make sense on its own, but the entire poem should have a hidden meaning related to the topic that you were writing about.\n\nFor example, a poem that references the ocean could have a last line like \u201cThe sky is falling, the earth is wet, I\u2019m going to go home and lie down now.\u201d\n\n9. Try an acrostic exercise\n\nAn acrostic poem is one where the first letters of each line spell out a word or phrase when written vertically. For example, in an acrostic poem about trees, the first letters of each line could spell out \u201cTREES\u201d vertically down the page.\n\nAcrostics are a great way to practice writing short lines that work together to form a whole image or idea.\n\n10. Experiment with different voices\n\nThe best way to learn how to write poetry is to try different voices and styles until you find one that works for you. Many beginning poets write all of their poetry in the same voice, but this can lead to stale, repetitive poetry.\n\nWrite one stanza in your normal voice, and then write another stanza in the voice of someone completely different \u2013 like a character from a movie or book.\n\n11. Use imagery\n\nImagery is a poetic technique used to create vivid mental pictures for the reader. Imagery can be visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, and/or olfactory. Good imagery can help the reader imagine and understand what the poet is trying to convey.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to write poetry because your poems are too long or boring, try using imagery in your next poem to spice things up!\n\n12. Practice reading your poetry aloud\n\nYou can try writing poetry on your own or with others. Read some examples of poetry and ask yourself what you like or don\u2019t like about them.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to start, try writing about something that has happened to you in the past month or something that you\u2019ve noticed in your daily life.\n\n13. Make use of your senses\n\nSensory detail is a great way to bring your poetry to life. You can write about how something smells, sounds, tastes, looks, or feels. Using words like \u201csmell\u201d and \u201csmell,\u201d \u201csound\u201d and \u201csound,\u201d \u201ctaste\u201d and \u201ctaste\u201d will help your reader imagine the scene you\u2019re trying to create.\n\nYou can also use adjectives that describe how", "completion_only": "Write about a topic, then remove any reference to it in the final line.

For example, in an acrostic poem about trees, the first letters of each line could spell out \u201cTREES\u201d vertically down the page.\n\nAcrostics are a great way to practice writing short lines that work together to form a whole image or idea.\n\n10. Experiment with different voices\n\nThe best way to learn how to write poetry is to try different voices and styles until you find one that works for you. Many beginning poets write all of their poetry in the same voice, but this can lead to stale, repetitive poetry.\n\nWrite one stanza in your normal voice, and then write another stanza in the voice of someone completely different \u2013 like a character from a movie or book.\n\n11. Use imagery\n\nImagery is a poetic technique used to create vivid mental pictures for the reader. Imagery can be visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, and/or olfactory. Good imagery can help the reader imagine and understand what the poet is trying to convey.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to write poetry because your poems are too long or boring, try using imagery in your next poem to spice things up!\n\n12. Practice reading your poetry aloud\n\nYou can try writing poetry on your own or with others. Read some examples of poetry and ask yourself what you like or don\u2019t like about them.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to start, try writing about something that has happened to you in the past month or something that you\u2019ve noticed in your daily life.\n\n13. Make use of your senses\n\nSensory detail is a great way to bring your poetry to life. You can write about how something smells, sounds, tastes, looks, or feels. Using words like \u201csmell\u201d and \u201csmell,\u201d \u201csound\u201d and \u201csound,\u201d \u201ctaste\u201d and \u201ctaste\u201d will help your reader imagine the scene you\u2019re trying to create.\n\nYou can also use adjectives that describe how", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 193, "avg_token_entropy": 1.2325371206253768, "avg_token_perplexity": 5.351967146518739, "prompt_type": "normal_prompt"}
