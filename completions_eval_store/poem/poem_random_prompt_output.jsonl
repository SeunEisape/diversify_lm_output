{"random_doc_file_path": "/home/eisape/projects/diversify_lm_output/dolma/data/v1_5r2_sample-0037.json.gz", "random_doc": "Did you know a marathon is hard?!\nBut super fun, too?!\nThe above image is me after running for 5 hours 52 minutes!! Of course it was hard, but I trained hard for it too and this will always be something I will be proud of.\nTo start off, I have to give a huge shout out to my support system! These ladies came out and stayed in the worse hotel in Memphis (Motel 6 don\u2019t go!). They were ran out by bed bugs at 3 in the morning and were standing at AutoZone Park ready to cheer us on bright and early at 6am!\nBeing surrounded by 26,000 runners to kick off the race was so crazy. It was just so amazing to be in that group of people who were running for so many different reasons.\nI was really grateful to start the race off with Sarah since we would not finish together. Let\u2019s talk about badass though!  Like what? I\u2019m just back here taking my sweet time!\nOne of my favorite things about the race was the city of Memphis! There were so many fans out there cheering complete strangers on. It was so fun. One street\u2019s neighborhood showed up! They had donut holes, shots, beer, Bloody Mary\u2019s, mimosas, chips, music! I was like Damn! Could you guys move to the end please?!\nI also loved being able to run through the St. Jude campus and see some of the patients that I raised money for. Props to those people who helped me reach that goal!\nI didn\u2019t have a goal for finishing by a certain time. I kept my pace around what I trained at, 11:30. Everything was good too. My hip didn\u2019t hurt, my nutrition was working, I was having fun. And then came Mile 20. Which was the furthest distance I had done during my training.\nI told a guy next to me, \u201cMile 23 to 26 is where winners are made!\u201d He was like \u201cOr failures.\u201d Ummmm, Boy, Bye!!\nAt that point though, your body is numb. You\u2019re hungry! And if you walk, you just think, RUN! So this will be over faster. Thanks to the tracking app, my friends and family were sending encouraging texts toward the end of the race which really helped me through.\nAs I crossed the finish line, I had tears in my eyes and thought, \u201cI cannot believe I just did that. Wait, yes I can. Of course I did that!\u201d It was so amazing. To be able to accomplish something that I had put so much work into was unbelievably gratifying.\n But now\u2026.I don\u2019t know. I might do some more. I will definitely be running half marathons, especially the St. Jude. I highly recommend this race to anyone! The expo was top notch. The after race goodies were great! So many options! Oranges, water, bananas, foil human burrito maker, pizza, donuts, BEER!\nAnd thanks to Sarah for waiting a whole hour after she was done for me to finish! It was great to see her smiling face when I came across. Then we had to walk up stairs to get to the food and beer! Like hello?! Whoever designed that has never done a marathon!\nLife has been slowly returning to normal. It only took us the whole month to recap our races. The New Year is right around the corner and we hope you stick with us to see what we have in store for 2018! The Badass Unicorns are here to stay and run around!\nSix days till we get in our little corral and nervously wait to cross the start line of our first marathon!!\nIt\u2019s been six months of training which means six months of sacrifices! We thought we would share some of the things we gave up so we could make this goal a reality.\nI didn\u2019t give up alcohol for the entire six months. I would sacrifice drinking on Friday nights because I would have a long run, bright and early! I did give up alcohol in the last month though. I made a couple exceptions, like Thanksgiving! I thought it would be nice to cleanse out those toxins in the last month so I would feel extra healthy for the race. I made sure to keep drinks on hand besides water. I learned that there is a habit in drinking, just having that glass of wine in hand after work. If I dressed up a virgin drink after work, it was almost like I was satisfying that craving with just a fancy drink. I will definitely be thinking of the nice, cold brew I\u2019ll treat myself to while running.\nTraining for a marathon while working a full time job is no joke! There were mornings I had to get up at 4 a.m. Sometimes I would be trying to beat the heat for a long run, others I would be trying to fit in a run before my work day started at 7 a.m. Usually with these early wake up calls would mean that I would be in bed by 8 p.m. asleep by 9. Now it\u2019s almost like I can\u2019t sleep past 7 a.m. and I really feel like it is a direct result of this crazy running lifestyle I developed.\nSacrificing comfort for me means that, at times, I was physically uncomfortable. Either having to wake up at 4:30 in the morning and make myself put my shoes on and get out the door. Or the aches and pains that your body goes through while training. Talk about getting up from sitting at work and every muscle in your body feels like it is protesting your movement! And of course, making yourself push yourself out of comfort zone while running. While I wasn\u2019t able to get faster through training (damn hip!) I was able to push myself way beyond my limits. I remember when I could barely run three miles and in six days I will be running 26.2. So it may hurt and you may feel defeated at times, but push yourself, it\u2019s worth it!\nI use to be good at making excuses. Then I became a runner! There are no excuses in running. December 2nd (date of the marathon) will come no matter how much training I have done. To make sure I was fully prepared for the marathon, I had to train, I had to run. No matter what life threw at me, I had to run. And if I absolutely had to skip a run, then I had to make it up later that week. Running has taught me that what I once thought were obstacles that were keeping me from doing things, were just my own excuses holding me back. Running teaches me how strong I really am and that there is nothing that can stop me from doing what I want to do, and nothing keeping me from becoming the strong, badass unicorn I am meant to be!\nRunning is uncomfortable. It is uncomfortable physically, emotionally, and mentally. I don\u2019t like being uncomfortable(who does?).

Yes, its uncomfortable, but did I die? NO! I got through it and I can do it again!\nI had to give up on giving up. You can see the finish line, but you can\u2019t feel your legs. You can\u2019t just stop. You have to keep going. I remember when running a mile was hard, and now in 6 more days I\u2019ll be running 26.2 miles. Will it be hard? Hell yes! But I know I will be able to do it because I haven\u2019t given up yet, and I\u2019m not going to start now! There would be no way I\u2019d be where I am today if I had given up. There is no way I\u2019d be the woman I am today if I had given up. Giving up is not an option. There is nothing like the feeling of when all you want to do is to stop and give up.  You may think that you could never run a marathon (yea, I thought that too). But if you work hard, train, embrace being uncomfortable, stop making excuses, and never give up, then you could run a marathon too and anything else you set your mind to!!\nI cannot find who to attribute this quote to but it was my mantra on my morning run today. I\u2019ve been watching these magnolias slowly open up to the world while I am running. It\u2019s been quite lovely.\nI have been running for two solid years and sometimes I get down on myself because I am not faster.

You can beat up a kickboxing bag like no body\u2019s business.\u201d And then my feet move faster.\nIt\u2019s all about perspective. I am not going to be a runner that gets caught up in pace all the time. Sometimes, yes. I want to do well in races. I can be competitive. But I don\u2019t ever want running to turn into something that I have to stress about. It\u2019s my relief. It\u2019s my happy place.\nIf you find yourself struggling with motivation, just be patient with yourself. Motivation is fickle. You need determination. Not just in running or exercise, but in anything you do. Sometimes you need a day off. Sometimes you need to get away from everything and regroup. That is okay. I encourage it!\nJust because we aren\u2019t a flower on a tree doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t a part of nature. We need time to let ourselves grow. We need time to find what works for us.

Just be patient.", "prompt": "Did you know a marathon is hard?!\nBut super fun, too?!\nThe above image is me after running for 5 hours 52 minutes!! Of course it was hard, but I trained hard for it too and this will always be something I will be proud of.\nTo start off, I have to give a huge shout out to my support system! These ladies came out and stayed in the worse hotel in Memphis (Motel 6 don\u2019t go!). They were ran out by bed bugs at 3 in the morning and were standing at AutoZone Park ready to cheer us on bright and early at 6am!\nBeing surrounded by 26,000 runners to kick off the race was so crazy. It was just so amazing to be in that group of people who were running for so many different reasons.\nI was really grateful to start the race off with Sarah since we would not finish together. Let\u2019s talk about badass though!  Like what? I\u2019m just back here taking my sweet time!\nOne of my favorite things about the race was the city of Memphis! There were so many fans out there cheering complete strangers on. It was so fun. One street\u2019s neighborhood showed up! They had donut holes, shots, beer, Bloody Mary\u2019s, mimosas, chips, music! I was like Damn! Could you guys move to the end please?!\nI also loved being able to run through the St. Jude campus and see some of the patients that I raised money for. Props to those people who helped me reach that goal!\nI didn\u2019t have a goal for finishing by a certain time. I kept my pace around what I trained at, 11:30. Everything was good too. My hip didn\u2019t hurt, my nutrition was working, I was having fun. And then came Mile 20. Which was the furthest distance I had done during my training.\nI told a guy next to me, \u201cMile 23 to 26 is where winners are made!\u201d He was like \u201cOr failures.\u201d Ummmm, Boy, Bye!!\nAt that point though, your body is numb. You\u2019re hungry! And if you walk, you just think, RUN! So this will be over faster. Thanks to the tracking app, my friends and family were sending encouraging texts toward the end of the race which really helped me through.\nAs I crossed the finish line, I had tears in my eyes and thought, \u201cI cannot believe I just did that. Wait, yes I can. Of course I did that!\u201d It was so amazing. To be able to accomplish something that I had put so much work into was unbelievably gratifying.\n But now\u2026.I don\u2019t know. I might do some more. I will definitely be running half marathons, especially the St. Jude. I highly recommend this race to anyone! The expo was top notch. The after race goodies were great! So many options! Oranges, water, bananas, foil human burrito maker, pizza, donuts, BEER!\nAnd thanks to Sarah for waiting a whole hour after she was done for me to finish! It was great to see her smiling face when I came across. Then we had to walk up stairs to get to the food and beer! Like hello?! Whoever designed that has never done a marathon!\nLife has been slowly returning to normal. It only took us the whole month to recap our races. The New Year is right around the corner and we hope you stick with us to see what we have in store for 2018! The Badass Unicorns are here to stay and run around!\nSix days till we get in our little corral and nervously wait to cross the start line of our first marathon!!\nIt\u2019s been six months of training which means six months of sacrifices! We thought we would share some of the things we gave up so we could make this goal a reality.\nI didn\u2019t give up alcohol for the entire six months. I would sacrifice drinking on Friday nights because I would have a long run, bright and early! I did give up alcohol in the last month though. I made a couple exceptions, like Thanksgiving! I thought it would be nice to cleanse out those toxins in the last month so I would feel extra healthy for the race. I made sure to keep drinks on hand besides water. I learned that there is a habit in drinking, just having that glass of wine in hand after work. If I dressed up a virgin drink after work, it was almost like I was satisfying that craving with just a fancy drink. I will definitely be thinking of the nice, cold brew I\u2019ll treat myself to while running.\nTraining for a marathon while working a full time job is no joke! There were mornings I had to get up at 4 a.m. Sometimes I would be trying to beat the heat for a long run, others I would be trying to fit in a run before my work day started at 7 a.m. Usually with these early wake up calls would mean that I would be in bed by 8 p.m. asleep by 9. Now it\u2019s almost like I can\u2019t sleep past 7 a.m. and I really feel like it is a direct result of this crazy running lifestyle I developed.\nSacrificing comfort for me means that, at times, I was physically uncomfortable. Either having to wake up at 4:30 in the morning and make myself put my shoes on and get out the door. Or the aches and pains that your body goes through while training. Talk about getting up from sitting at work and every muscle in your body feels like it is protesting your movement! And of course, making yourself push yourself out of comfort zone while running. While I wasn\u2019t able to get faster through training (damn hip!) I was able to push myself way beyond my limits. I remember when I could barely run three miles and in six days I will be running 26.2. So it may hurt and you may feel defeated at times, but push yourself, it\u2019s worth it!\nI use to be good at making excuses. Then I became a runner! There are no excuses in running. December 2nd (date of the marathon) will come no matter how much training I have done. To make sure I was fully prepared for the marathon, I had to train, I had to run. No matter what life threw at me, I had to run. And if I absolutely had to skip a run, then I had to make it up later that week. Running has taught me that what I once thought were obstacles that were keeping me from doing things, were just my own excuses holding me back. Running teaches me how strong I really am and that there is nothing that can stop me from doing what I want to do, and nothing keeping me from becoming the strong, badass unicorn I am meant to be!\nRunning is uncomfortable.

Sadly, many do not.\n\"The majority said they were not in a position where they needed a shelter, \" Dufrene added. \"But so many people have no way out unless somebody helps them.\"\nThat is exactly one of the missions of Faith House - to provide that place where survivors and victims can go for safety. Voss said fundraisers like this one will help keep that mission alive. The organization is expecting a crowd of about 300 people, many will be survivors and families of domestic abuse victims.\nUL Atchafalaya Ballroom.\nTickets are $75 per person or $600 per table and can be purchased at www.faithhouseacadiana.com.\nFor more information on our Prince Tribute Teams and to make a donation to one of the teams, visit www.accelevents.com/events/faithhousetribute.\n\nWrite a 250-word poem: 125 words minimum.\n\nIf you don't have a computer just bring a sheet of paper and a pen to write it.\nIf your writing is really good, you could write it into your final paper.", "completion_only": "125 words minimum.\n\nIf you don't have a computer just bring a sheet of paper and a pen to write it.\nIf your writing is really good, you could write it into your final paper.", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 3, "avg_token_entropy": 2.0815340812717165, "avg_token_perplexity": 10.714869547653302, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

Of course, with technology making great strides ahead, everything is for the convenience of mankind. Ever since internet came into being, many have opted to do their shopping online for anything. However, when you\u2019re going for ammo, it is advised you know exactly what you\u2019re looking for. It isn\u2019t the cheap prices alone that you need to look for while purchasing ammo online. Other factors such as the right type of ammo as per your requirement should be considered if you\u2019re going to hunt or shoot.\nOne of the most important things to look before purchasing ammo is the type of bullet. This will basically depend on the type of gun or rifle you possess and what you will be hunting. In case you are planning on taking long shots, then a softer bullet or a hollow point will be the right choice. This is considered the right choice as the bullet will open up even after having lost much energy when in downrange. However, in the event of taking closer shots, it is recommended that you go for a harder, jacketed round. Choosing this will allow the bullet a deeper penetration and stop it from coming apart on impact.\nIf accuracy is a factor, then match grade ammunition is the ammo for you as it is usually meant for shooting competitions. This is because they have greater consistency in the loads. You must note that this type of ammo is known to shoot more consistently than most hunters need. However, this advantage does come with a condition: you will need to pay considerably for that extra accuracy. But, there is always the chance of getting those prices down if you\u2019re to go for a bulk purchase of the ammo. You just need to look for a website which offers this type of ammunition for sale online at considerable rates.\nSo, know this \u2013 the next time you\u2019re online looking for the best ammo prices online \u2013 just remember that the cheapest prices aren\u2019t really your requirement. Despite the vast amount of information available online, it is best if you took some time and did a little research before making that purchase. Now go ahead and save yourself the time and money and happy hunting!\nWrite a 250-word poem: Write a 250-word poem that expresses the importance of family and community and how one is dependent on the other.\n\n\nPosted in Uncategorized | Leave a comment\n\nBest of luck in English Language test\n\nDear friend,\nWe wish you all the best.

It is a really powerful language, but the web is moving in a different direction. JavaScript is becoming a more and more complex language with new syntax all the time.\n\nLet's look at jQuery again, we can add a bunch of fancy features like animation, smooth scrolling, event listeners, etc. We can do that all in a library like jQuery. Now, there is a really great library out there called MooTools, that I've been using for a while. It is a library that builds on the basic concept of jQuery and adds some really cool features like class selectors, css filters, and class change, to name a few. MooTools is a library written in JavaScript, with all of these features built in already. We can still do all of the above with jQuery or MooTools, it just takes more time and effort to build the functionality.\n\nMooTools is not really a good example of an OOP language, it doesn't have a lot of the OOP features like inheritance. MooTools just adds features to the JavaScript language that we could write ourselves, but would take a lot of effort.\n\nSo now what? It's all about OOP. We can use all of these new JavaScript features, but the new framework is all about OOP. This framework is based on JavaScript and is designed with OOP in mind. We can actually reuse JavaScript code, that we've written, in the new framework.\n\nAs I said, OOP is all about inheritance and we can create this inheritance by creating classes. In the JavaScript world, classes are objects, which can inherit from other objects. So if we have a \"button\" object, we can create another \"button\" object, that extends the first \"button\" object. This second \"button\" object now has all of the functionality of the first \"button\" object. This \"button\" object can also add it's own functionality to the \"button\" object, but this is a whole nother story, and I'll talk more about that in a minute.\n\nWe can also use functions, to create objects. There is a method in JavaScript called Function. This method allows us to create objects from code, instead of from code.\n\nIn a nutshell, a class is an object that inherits from a parent object. Let's take a step back and talk about how a class is different from a \"function.\"\n\nA function is", "completion_only": "The Tuck Company / Tuck University\n\nJavaScript can now do all of this and more.

His teams weren't gimmicky; in fact, Noll had to be prodded into using the shotgun formation. His teams just won, baby.\nIn \"Chuck Noll: His Life's Work,\" veteran sportswriter Michael MacCambridge revisits the milestones while also revealing facets of Noll's life that even a Pittsburgh native like yours truly didn't know about, such as his passion for hobbies (including photography, wine and flying airplanes) and his medical challenges, first with epilepsy and then with Alzheimer's disease.\nBorn in 1932 in Cleveland, Noll's memory and sharp intelligence made him successful in school, but his passion was football. Tellingly, as a boy he played on an interracial neighborhood team led by a black coach \u2014 not a common situation in the 1940s in a Rust Belt city. Noll played well enough in high school to walk on at Notre Dame, the dream school and team for a Catholic lad. But an epileptic seizure at practice led coach Frank Leahy to dismiss him from the squad. He found a second chance at the University of Dayton where, through will and skill, the undersized Noll made himself into an offensive lineman good enough to be drafted by, and play for, the Cleveland Browns for six seasons.\nNoll served as an assistant coach under innovative Sid Gillman and then for Don Shula before the Steelers hired him in 1969, making him the youngest head coach in NFL history at that time. His hiring began the turnaround of a family-owned franchise that had been a football joke for decades. Strong drafts filled the roster with future Hall of Famers, perhaps none more important than Joe Greene, the dominating defensive tackle whom MacCambridge describes as the team's emotional leader.\nMacCambridge appears to have talked with every living member of the Steelers family about Noll except quarterback Terry Bradshaw, who refused to speak about his former coach. Drawing on Bradshaw's past (sometimes contradictory) accounts and third-party interviews, the biographer paints the picture of a talented but insecure QB and a coach who didn't coddle. \"One of Chuck's \u2026 methods was to stare Bradshaw straight in the face to emphasize a point, with a hand on each of Bradshaw's shoulder pads,\" MacCambridge writes.\nAt the onset of the 1974 season, which would end with the Steelers' first Super Bowl victory, Noll benched Bradshaw in favor of strong-armed Joe Gilliam, making Gilliam the first African-American QB in the post-merger era to start a season opener. After a few good games, Gilliam's performance fell off, likely affected by his substance abuse, leading to Bradshaw's return. While teammates split on the merits of the QBs, wide receiver John Stallworth told MacCambridge there was no dissension in the locker room, because players knew Noll's decisions weren't based on race.\n\"He was one of the last of hugely successful NFL coaches to have an identifiable life outside of football, to be such a well-rounded person,\" MacCambridge writes. (To wit: How many stories have you read about Mike McCarthy's hobbies?) In that spirit, MacCambridge devotes considerable words to Noll's family life. No one, not even his devoted wife Marianne, would call him a warm and fuzzy guy.

For some players, that sadness was tied to the memory of Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis, who had retired two years earlier.\nIn 2005, as the Steelers were making their run toward the final showdown at the Georgia Dome, Bettis was at his favorite hangout, a Chinese restaurant in the Strip District in Pittsburgh. As he told ESPN's Jeff Zillgitt, \"It just hit me like a ton of bricks. This is the last year. I was there in Atlanta. It was my last Super Bowl.\"\nThe following year, Bettis and the Steelers went 11-5, good for a wild-card playoff berth. \"It was the end of the road,\" Bettis said.\nBut the end wasn't over for the franchise. Bettis was replaced by Willie Parker, the team's rushing leader with an average of more than 5 yards per carry. \"He ran with a certain fury in 2006 that was missing in Pittsburgh,\" writes Guerin. \"After Bettis and the great Jerome Brown went down with injuries, his teammates knew it was their duty to find ways to help those who stepped in. No one was more deserving of a replacement, or was replaced as well as Parker.\"\nIt was Parker's 2-yard touchdown run that gave the Steelers a 21-18 victory over the Colts. When he slid into the end zone, Guerin writes, \"There was only a hint of jubilation. His teammates knew exactly how he felt. In a sense, that moment was just as special to the Steelers in 2006 as Super Bowl XL against Seattle. They knew that they were just as close to losing the playoffs as they were winning them.\"\nIn the final season of his career, Bettis had an opportunity to coach the Steelers when Tomlin, then an assistant coach, was named head coach in 2007.

the same company contracted to clear the Saxonvale regeneration site in Frome ahead of the planned construction of new homes and commercial units there.\nThe proposed \"throughabout\" involves building a new road through the centre of the roundabout, allowing traffic between the two busiest points to move straight across, freeing up space that could be filled by other drivers.\nThe new road through the middle of the roundabout to directly connect the A38 with the motorway junction, with new pedestrian and cycling links to the town centre also being delivered.\nBoth of these elements were originally part of the \u00a322.6m Bridgwater town deal, before the county council was awarded more than \u00a310m from the levelling up fund to improve the \"A38 Bridgwater Northern Corridor\" in October 2021.\nThe pre-construction contract is worth \u00a3722,032, according to documents published on the council's website.\nOf the total cost of the scheme, estimated at \u00a35.24m, up to \u00a32.3m will come from Sedgemoor District Council, whose executive committee voted in February 2021 to borrow up to \u00a34.7m to ensure the scheme could proceed.\nA further \u00a3400,000 will come from the Bridgwater town deal, \u00a3250,000 will be contributed by National Highways (formerly Highways England -

While on vacation here Thompson went for a walk and never returned. A massive manhunt ensued, to no avail. To this day no one knows what happened to the textile giant, and many have found a way to cash in on the mystery, offering special tours and menu items dedicated to the man.\nFor us, the hillsides offered crisp air and a fresh perspective.\nEverywhere you turn there are souvenir shops brimming with strawberry themed knick-knacks.

When I think of a place that means something, I don\u2019t think of the specific landmarks and sights I experience. I don\u2019t think of the souvenir stores filled with strange things that I will never find at home. No, the memory of a place, when it is strong enough, is something that you feel, not something you describe. There is a memory of a day on a mountaintop, in a valley. There is a memory of a night in a high place where the air was cool. There is a memory of a place so pure, and innocent, where people cared about the health of their planet, and didn\u2019t feel the need to constantly pollute it. The air smelled fresh, and the earth was green. The plants grew close, and the animals lived nearby. The people knew how to survive off the earth. They were content. They were simple. They were happy. No skyscrapers here. No neon lights. No fancy malls to go to. No traffic jams. Only the earth, and the people who lived there.

And it doesn't impact income tax relief at all if it's within the same tax year.\nWrite a 250-word poem:\u00a0You are a teacher.\n\nYou are more than just a teacher,\n\nbut you do teach\n\nyou teach with your mouth and your hands,\n\nyou teach with your heart.\n\nSometimes you have to use all three,\n\nto teach someone who doesn't know what you're teaching\n\nsomeone who is scared\n\nsomeone who is confused\n\nsomeone who just doesn't care\n\nand then you see a sparkle in their eye,\n\na tiny little light\n\nand then you teach\n\nyou teach with just your eyes\n\nyou teach with a soft, gentle voice\n\nyou teach because you care\n\nand then one day, it all comes together\n\nthe knowledge you give is a light\n\nand then you teach with your whole soul\n\nyou teach with your whole life\n\nand it doesn't matter if you get paid for teaching\n\nbecause you just love to do it.\n\nIt might not always be a spark\n\nsometimes it's a fire\n\nand you teach because you can't stop\n\nYou just have to.\n\nYou're a teacher.\n\nI want to know the secrets of the world\n\nthat I am forbidden to know.\n\nI want to know the secrets of the stars.\n\nI want to know the secrets of the Universe.\n\nI want to know the secrets of the Universe\n\nbefore I die.\n\nI want to know the secrets of the Universe\n\nbefore I die.\n\nI am forbidden to know them\n\nso I do not tell others,\n\nbut I hope that one day,\n\none day,\n\nI will.\n\nI want to know the secrets of the world\n\nthat I am forbidden to know.\n\n\n  1.
