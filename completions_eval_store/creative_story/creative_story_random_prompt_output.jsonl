What is interesting about all of this is the supposed crimes were committed largely against eager and willing victims.\nWhen it comes to the idea of human trafficking, the United States is currently in the midst of a Moral Panic. Supposedly 15,000 people are so trafficked every year but there is almost no actual evidence to support this number. That hasn\u2019t stopped the government and a large number of well-meaning but largely self-deluded citizens from passing useless laws and spending hundreds of millions of dollars to combat the largely non-existent problem.\nThat\u2019s where Mack and a fellow named Keith Raniere get involved. Raniere is a despicable fellow. He runs a multi-level marketing company called NXIVM which is slightly different than others of its kind. Instead of simply bilking people of their money with barely legal promises, he also uses the company to convince women to serve as his sexual slaves. Under his charismatic control they allowed themselves to be branded with his initials in their pubic regions. Mack served as leader of a subsidiary organization that recruited women to serve sexually. DOS stands for dominus obsequious sororium which is Latin for master over the slave women.\nThere are allegations that Mack and Raniere used blackmail to keep women in NXIVM and this is against the law. The fact that women joined a group and served as sex slaves is not, much as many would like it to be, a crime.  Where there are charges of coercion and blackmail, they should be investigated.\nIf Mack was involved with blackmail she should be so charged. The problem here is we are using laws created to stop a non-existent problem to prosecute people for a particular activity we find distasteful. Something that should never have been illegal in the first place. This is a microcosm of the entire War on Drugs and also the needless traffic crimes which result in the theft of billions of dollars from citizens.\nI think it is telling when the government went to Mexico to arrest Raniere, the woman at his compound hopped into their cars and chased the police all the way to the airport trying to rescue him. They are clearly not victims here. Certainly, they are dupes and fools but they are participating in something and they eagerly want to continue to do so. The government should not be trying to prevent us from doing that which we desire, even if it isn\u2019t in our best self-interest. That is our job.\nRaniere is scum. Mack is as well. But unless they drug an unwilling victim and keep them imprisoned either physically or through blackmail, they haven\u2019t committed a crime. I know the headlines are shrieking human trafficking but that\u2019s not what happened.\nAs much as my stomach is turned by the behavior of Raniere and Mack, their freedom is my freedom. If they can be arrested for convincing someone to be a sex slave can I be arrested for convincing someone to purchase my books because the government might not like their content? It\u2019s not as big a stretch as you might imagine.\nWe must guard not only our freedom, but those who we dislike as well, particularly those whose behavior is most disturbing.\nHero or Bad Example to Save Rabbit from Fire?\nA video of a young man standing near an intense fire in California and rescuing a rabbit attempting to flee the flames has engendered a bit of controversy that I\u2019d like to examine. One group of people, apparently the majority, think he is an amazing hero while another group think he was incredibly foolish and set a terrible example.\nIt\u2019s an interesting case. If he had rushed toward the fire to save a baby would the perception be different? If he was a trained firefighter would people view his actions in a different light? The debate seems to largely center around the fact he risked his life, a human life, to save that of a common animal.\n The second group includes those of the opinion the life of the rabbit is of equal importance to that of the man; that his actions are noble in that regard. Others do not argue the life of the rabbit equivalent to that of a person but still laud his actions as heroic and worthwhile.\nA human life might well be more important than the rabbit. I think arguments can be made that given a choice between saving a human baby and saving a rabbit, the objectively correct choice would be to save the baby. Some of my more passionate animal rights friends will argue the rabbit life is perhaps of greater importance than one of the seven and a half billion people living on the planet. There are likely fewer rabbits than people.\nTo me the life of the rabbit and the life of the young rescuer are of little importance to the question. Likewise, the inspirational impact of the young man is not a primary factor I consider. To me it comes down to my Libertarian principles. He wanted to save the rabbit. He chose to do so. He was not coerced into doing so. He was successful and I think it cannot be debated his life was enriched. Perhaps he will look back on his actions with sheepish regret and realize risking his own life, and perhaps others who might have had to rescue him should he have succumbed to smoke inhalation, was not worth the risk. But, his actions reflect his clearly powerful desires of the moment.\nLet\u2019s imagine he did fall while making the attempt. That another person went to rescue him and died in the effort. The same principles I\u2019m applying to the young man work with the hypothetical rescuer. She or he chose to make the attempt. That is what being free is all about. This is the heart of the Libertarian Movement.\nThe government solution is that we must be protected from doing things that might cause us harm. I would not be surprised to see legislation arise in some states making it illegal to attempt to rescue wildlife from dangerous situations.\nIt is clear the young man put himself in danger. He might inspire others to do the same. So what? What business is it of yours, of the government\u2019s? It\u2019s his life and, as long as he\u2019s not harming others, he should be able to lead it as he chooses!\nIf you think he\u2019s a hero that\u2019s great.  The important point is that he did as he chose to do, as should we all.\nI just watched an interesting video on YouTube about pedestrian citations. Basically, pedestrians are given tickets for various violations including jaywalking and a litany of other things. The idea behind the citations is they are issued for the protection of citizens. Not crossing at a crosswalk is potentially a dangerous activity.\nWhile I\u2019m certain you won\u2019t be surprised blacks and Hispanics receive the majority of these pedestrian citations, that\u2019s not really what I want to talk about today. It\u2019s the government supposedly trying to protect us that bothers me. In reality they are simply financing themselves through citations. The reason I say this is because the studies show these tickets are often given in areas where pedestrians have little choice but to break the law.\nIn the case of Florida, where the video originated, they are often given on streets where there is no sidewalk to use and yet there are bus stops. People must get to the bus stop but they can\u2019t get there without walking on the street, which is a violation. Many other instances are when people move from one side of the street to the other but not at a crosswalk.\nWhen you examine the region, there are no crosswalks available for multiple blocks. The alternative being to walk three, four, or more blocks out of your way to cross the street. I don\u2019t care how much of a law and order person you are, that\u2019s a law no one is going to follow.\nThe reality is making the streets safer for pedestrians involves spending money on building better sidewalks, designating more crosswalks, and a variety of other things. If the government actually wanted to make us safer, that\u2019s what they\u2019d do. Citations for these sorts of silly things are merely an excuse to generate revenue for the city.\nFor example, in my state of Missouri I violate a pedestrian law on an almost daily basis by walking on the left half of a crosswalk. Code 300.385. I\u2019m fairly certain every person reading this article has violated this law many times. Because this law is violated constantly it becomes rife for abuse. The officer can charge whomever she or he feels like charging and let anyone else go merrily on their way. This is the problem with many laws and why we see people of color getting the majority of such citations, although, again, that\u2019s not my main problem here.\nThe problem is the law. Let\u2019s take 300.385 as an example of a law which continues to exist largely because of its revenue generating potential. The government will tell us the law was written to cut down on inconvenience when crossing the street at a crosswalk. By keeping opposite flowing pedestrian traffic on different sides, it is a better system. I don\u2019t disagree with the principle of the idea. It is a good strategy. It just shouldn\u2019t be a law punishable by a fine.\nIf someone wants to cross on the opposite side and there is no, or little, oncoming pedestrian traffic; all is well. If, on the other hand, the crosswalk is filled with people going both directions and someone is swimming upstream they are generally given dirty looks and even forced to the other side. That\u2019s enough punishment. We don\u2019t need to take people\u2019s money in order to get them to walk on the convenient side of the crosswalk. Are we going to have laws forcing people to wait before entering a mass transit vehicle thus allowing exiting people to go first?\nIt is against the law to change lanes without signaling. It is against the law to make a turn and switch from one lane to another while doing so. There is virtually no one in the nation who doesn\u2019t break laws on a daily basis.\nThe question I\u2019d like you to ask yourself is relatively simple. If law enforcement agents started to enforce these laws on people driving a Mercedes, a Lexus, a Tesla, a BMW, and other expensive cars; if law enforcement agents started enforcing jaywalking laws on people wearing expensive clothes; if law enforcement agents started citing politicians at the state capital for crossing on the wrong half of the crosswalk; how long before the laws would change?\nThese laws are a tool of oppression on those who cannot defend themselves and serve the sole purpose of financing government agents without making life any safer or better for citizens. That\u2019s just plain wrong.\nOne of my Facebook acquaintances who is deeply passionate about animal rights recently posted about the Lychee Dog Meat festival in China. I think it\u2019s fairly reasonable to suggest that most of us in the western world are not particularly comfortable with eating canines. What can be done about it? What is the best way to stop such behavior? This question speaks to my Libertarian ideology.\nI recently wrote several blogs about the horse meat industry and I think the comparison is reasonable. When horse lovers lobbied Congress sufficiently, laws were passed that defunded the inspection of horse slaughter houses. Because it is not legal to slaughter animals in the United States without such inspections, the industry was eliminated. Yet, the practice continues.\nThe efforts of people like my friend on Facebook are used to put pressure on China to outlaw the Lychee festival. In China manipulative legislative runarounds like that which was done with the horse meat industry are unnecessary. They do not live in a free society. If the government wants to prevent a particular activity, they simply issue a ban. There is no Constitution to maneuver around. If my friend and her allies can put enough pressure on China to outlaw the festival, it will happen, but will it work?\nIn China the government position is that the Chinese people do not hold dogs in the same regard as companions as do Westerners. They find our slaughter of cows and chickens to be far more egregious than the single festival in which a few thousand dogs die. In this, I believe they are correct. \nOpponents of the festival argue the dogs die in unsupervised, and horrific fashion. That many of the animals are stolen from their owners. I have no way of knowing if this is true or not but it certainly seems plausible.\nNow we get down to the reality of this world. The Chinese people enjoy the meat of dogs. The people of the United States largely find such slaughter abhorrent.\nLet\u2019s imagine for a moment that the Chinese government comes around the way of thinking of my friend. They ban the slaughter of dogs, they outlaw the Lychee festival. Do we think that such will prevent dogs from being slaughtered and eaten? The answer is obviously no. As long as Chinese people want to eat dogs, dogs will be eaten. Horses are still slaughtered and eaten in the United States, it is just done via a black market. The price increases, money is delivered into the hands of criminals. The ban is largely ineffective.\nIt seems obvious to me such would be the case in China. The Chinese government might even give lip service to such a ban but would not bother to enforce it. This is the problem with relying on government to solve problems. Sure, they can pass laws, they can make heroin illegal, they can make speeding illegal, they can outlaw certain variety of firearms, but these laws never stop human behavior. If people want to consume drugs, to drive quickly, to purchase firearms; they will continue to do so.\nWe only give ourselves the illusion of safety and harmony with such laws. In reality the behavior continues largely unabated or even enhanced by the lure of danger.\nWhat is to be done? My friend is passionate, she is caring, she strongly believes in the rights of animals. I applaud and admire her dedication and think it is people like her who will eventually bring about change, if change is to come. She should continue to make her opinion known, convince one person at a time. It is only when people no longer want to consume dogs, or horses, that the Lychee festival will end. The government is helpless and hopeless.\nDo not rely on government to legislate. Convince people, convince the individual. The individual has the power. If you cannot convince the people, then you need to make a better argument.\nI was thinking about the idea of an apology. You say or do something you regret. You say you\u2019re sorry. The natural reaction of the person or people you\u2019ve offended or angered is to accept the apology. It is almost as if some part, if not all, of the original transgression never happened. But what is an apology? Just words. I\u2019m beginning to become skeptical about accepting those words, they are merely a way for the person giving the apology to feel better. I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t want apologies anymore, I want to see a change in your behavior. That\u2019s a real apology. If that\u2019s beyond you, fine. Let\u2019s both move on.\nI\u2019m sure this is coming across as rather cruel and heartless and perhaps it is. It\u2019s just that I often see people giving what appears to be heartfelt apologies for particular misbehaviors and then going right back to repeating the offending behavior in exactly the same fashion.\nI\u2019m sometimes willing to believe the apology is sincere. The person does feel bad about what she or he did. But the apology is nothing more than a symptom masking panacea. The offending person is fixed and can go on about their life without further worry, until they do it again. It\u2019s an endless cycle of misbehavior and apology. There is no effort to fix the underlying problem, or perhaps there is an attempt but it ends in failure. The apology is a central part of the ongoing problem.\nIt seems to me, quite frequently the words are completely phony. The person is only apologizing because the behavior generated unfavorable results. The person isn\u2019t really sorry at all. They are sorry about the consequences but they acted exactly in the fashion they desired. The only thing they\u2019d change about the incident that requires an apology is the resulting upset.\nHowever, if the person actually changes their behavior over the course of the next several years, that would seem to me to be a real apology. I\u2019m sorry I did something and I recognize what I did was wrong. Every time I\u2019m in a situation in which I could repeat the behavior, I react differently. That\u2019s an apology I can get behind.\nSo, there you have it. If you offend me and aren\u2019t sorry. That\u2019s cool. Tell me you\u2019re not sorry and I\u2019ll deal with it. If you are sorry, change your behavior. If I offend you, tell me about it and I\u2019ll try my best to change my behavior if I feel I was in the wrong. Apologies aren\u2019t worthy of accepting or rejecting.\nSometimes I wonder why I don\u2019t have a lot of friends, then I remember!\nI\u2019ve been reading a number stories about Martha Stewart and her feelings about being imprisoned in 2004 for conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements in regards to the sale of ImClone Systems stocks. She felt it was a horrible experience and she learned nothing from it.\nI think there are a number of things to take from Stewart\u2019s opinion on this subject not the least of which is that she was convicted in what most people would regard as questionable fashion and I would classify as grossly unjust. I find her words about her imprisonment resonate strongly with me. She was not made stronger for her stay in jail, she learned nothing, she did not become a better person. It was horrible in every regard. This is an indictment of our prison system.\nFirst, I\u2019d like to talk about her conviction. She sold some stock shortly before it went down by 16% and avoided about $50,000 in losses. This may seem like a lot to you and me but to a woman of her means, it is a fairly trivial amount. Her broker supposedly was informed by an insider that a drug the company was promoting failed to gain approval. Stewart claimed there was a standard order to sell when it reached a certain price, $60, and had documentation that such an order existed.\nAn ink expert from the Secret Service testified the ink on the order for the ImClone sale was different than other ink on the document. He lied. He hadn\u2019t even examined the document. Another worker examined it and it was clear she had a grudge against Stewart. The case of securities fraud against Stewart was so flimsy the judge threw it out of court. But, Stewart insisted the order for sale at $60 was real and she was convicted on charges related to these statements. This despite the fact the person who claimed it was different ink was lying. She was not convicted of securities fraud. The civil case was eventually settled with Stewart paying the government the equivalent of triple damages although she maintained her innocence.\nSo, off she went to a minimum-security prison. Here\u2019s where her comments really caught my eye. She was asked if the sentence and imprisonment made her stronger. If the adversity was essentially good for her. This question reflects what we\u2019d like prison to be. A place where inmates reflect upon their misdeeds and emerge the better for it. No, said Stewart. It was not a learning experience. It did not make her stronger. It was horrible. It was only her own strength of character that allowed her to endure. This confirms my opinion that prison is not making better people but is largely making better criminals. It is not turning criminals into good citizens but conversely, turning good citizens into criminals.\nThis assessment is coming from an undeniably strong woman who was sent into what is largely considered the least penal sort of prison. Imagine men and women of lesser character getting sent to far worse places. We turn a young person who perhaps robbed a store, got caught with some small amount of drugs, or perhaps got into a drunken fight into a hardened criminal by sending them to our failed jails.\nIf the goal is to have a better society, to have better people, then we must listen to what Stewart has to say. If we merely want to punish people and ensure they are more likely to commit crimes after their release, then we can safely ignore Stewart\u2019s advice. It\u2019s important to note that Stewart is not merely answering a question, she is unleashing a stinging and startlingly accurate indictment of our entire system. I\u2019m not surprised, she is a woman of tremendous strength.\nIf you choose to ignore her, do so at your own peril. More and better criminals is not a recipe for a successful society.\nThere is an interesting phenomenon going on surrounding the behavior of people during the playing of the national anthem. I don\u2019t want to talk about the reason behind the kneeling but the reaction to the protests.\nThere are largely two categories of offense in these situations. Either you are affected or you are not.  The national anthem protests fall into the latter category. Blocking traffic would be the former. Your reaction to events that don\u2019t affect you is an insight into your character.\nThe stronger you are as a person the less you should react to affronts that don\u2019t affect you. If you are secure in your patriotism, why would you feel the need to force someone else into an act you deem patriotic? It is your own insecurities that rouse your ire, much more than the protest.\nBiblically, Jesus used the idea of love to demonstrate this principle. If you love yourself, you love everyone else. Their feelings toward you are irrelevant, if they hate you that is too bad but it doesn\u2019t change your opinion of them. It is only when you have feelings of doubt and insecurity in yourself that you worry what other people are thinking. Buddha and enlightenment is another example of this principle. The more secure you are in your own opinions, the less you feel it necessary to make others conform to those particular standards.\nI\u2019m certainly not criticizing anyone for standing during the national anthem but I do find their rage and urge to punish anyone who does not to be an underlying weakness of character, not a strength. If you really believed in your patriotic stance, you wouldn\u2019t need to coerce others through force, economic or social, to conform to the ideologies you hold dear. You would simply smile and be comfortable in your own behavior. Those who are secure don\u2019t need to be constantly reinforced by others. Those who are weak, who are insecure, require such reassurances.\nI\u2019m also not suggesting that such strength is easy to acquire and to demonstrate consistently. I think the ideals proposed by stories of Jesus and Buddha are essentially unobtainable, but still well worth pursuing. Everyone gets a sense of ease from being in a group of like-minded people. It is simply human nature to enjoy such comradery. When I am in a large group of people who share my ideology, I am reassured that I myself must be correct, this is a false comfort. Their agreement, or disagreement, with me has nothing to do with my own opinion.\nI don\u2019t hold myself up as a shining example of strength or perfection, but I also feel secure enough in my own beliefs that I don\u2019t attempt to forcefully make people do as I do. I\u2019m a Libertarian and an Atheist but I\u2019m not offended by Democrats or Christians. I make my points as honestly as I can and I leave the decision up to you. If you choose to believe or behave differently than me, so be it. Best of luck to you. This is strength of character.\nNot that I\u2019m telling you how to act. That\u2019s your decision, I am suggesting you look at your behavior with an eye toward critical thinking. Trying to force people into conforming to your way of doing things is a sign of tremendous weakness and insecurity, not power.\nI\u2019m lucky enough to live in the Central West End where the St. Louis Chess club is currently hosting the Sinquefield Cup and recently former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov visited the studio and joined Yasser Seirawan and Jennifer Shahade. During his chat, he essentially completely ignored Shahade both in spoken words and body language.\nIt\u2019s an interesting situation because I doubt Kasparov is misogynistic. The first reality we must take into account is that Seirawan is objectively a better chess player than Shahade. Therefore, when analyzing the various games, it was to be expected that Kasparov would rely more on the opinion of Seirawan.\n Not to say he doesn\u2019t deserve to think highly of himself, he was the best chess player in the world for a very long time and it can be argued he is the best to have ever played the game. He doesn\u2019t suffer fools lightly, as the saying goes.\nBut, even taking all of that into account, Kasparov barely even gave indication that he knew Shahade was in the room, occasionally glancing at her with his eyes but never directly addressing her or asking her any questions. He leaned toward Seirawan the entire time he was in the studio. The mood was so obvious the camera crew focused in on the two men in a tight shot for the majority of the interview.\nThe obvious conclusion we can draw is that Kasparov is misogynistic, but I\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t think he is such. Chess is a sport that is dominated by men even today, but was even more so in the era when Kasparov was world champion. It\u2019s most likely, although I am not certain, Kasparov never analyzed a single chess game in his long career with a woman.\nOf particular note is his opinion of Judit Polgar who is largely considered the best woman chess player in history. Early in her career Kasparov was asked about her potential and gave what can only be called a misogynistic statement: She has fantastic chess talent, but she is, after all, a woman. It all comes down to the imperfections of the feminine psyche. No woman can sustain a prolonged battle. Later in life, however, after he had lost a rapid game against Polgar in 2002, Kasparov revised his opinion: The Polgars showed that there are no inherent limitations to their aptitude \u2026.\nI think it\u2019s fair to say Kasparov maintains some dismissive attitudes towards women chess players and it came through, certainly unintentionally, during the interview.\n Be careful out there, people are watching!\nTeens committing suicide playing Blue Whale Challenge scream the headlines. Tenuous and often fraudulent links to people who committed suicide while supposedly playing the game immediately follow. Moral Panic sets in.\nBasically, there isn\u2019t much evidence young people are committing suicide because they were instructed to do so as part of the Blue Whale Challenge. The game supposedly involves a series of dares that occur over fifty days with the last challenge being to self-film the player\u2019s own suicide.\nFirst off, I\u2019m highly skeptical this is real. It has all the hallmarks of a hoax and the Safer Internet Centre, a European Agency, seems to think so. Secondly, I\u2019m not sure encouraging someone to kill themselves is a crime. I wrote about this in conjunction with the Michelle Carter case so I won\u2019t go on endlessly here. Providing material assistance to someone who is going to commit suicide is probably criminal. Knowing someone is attempting to commit suicide and not reporting it might be a crime. Encouraging someone to kill his or her self is despicable; but I think not criminal.\nThen there is the idea of a Moral Panic. This is basically when society learns of some danger and begins to enact laws and regulations to prevent harm from coming to its citizens. The problem is the danger never really existed at all, or was happening to such a small percentage of people that the methods enacted to prevent it actually cause more harm than the original issue.\nI argue the entire War on Drugs is a Moral Panic. Drug use causes for less damage than the interdiction methods introduced to reduce drug addiction problems. We\u2019d be far better off today if never began the War on Drugs, thus when I see something like the Blue Whale Challenge I become concerned. In the United States people are already proposing laws similar to those enacted in Russia where the Moral Panic is already in full swing.\nIn Russia, there are now laws against a website that promotes suicide and laws against encouraging a minor to commit suicide. Several people have thus far been imprisoned. I know what you\u2019re thinking, good. Those are bad things. We should have laws against them. The problem is the impact of those laws.\n I understand telling someone to kill themselves is nasty and reprehensible. I get why people want laws to prevent shameful behavior. I get children can be vulnerable to manipulation and sometimes need special protections not in place for adults. I just don\u2019t think it should be the government\u2019s responsibility to monitor this sort of thing. We can\u2019t legislate morality and the more we try, the more problems we cause.\nI can\u2019t tell you all the problems these sorts of laws might cause down the road, but I\u2019m convinced they will create more difficulties than they actually solve. These laws won\u2019t stop people from playing the Blue Whale Challenge or being administrators, if anyone actually is playing. They will just push the situation further underground.\nSome people will commit suicide. Some people will encourage others to do so because they are failed humans. We can be better friends to those in need. We can spend our time helping people, rather than hurting them. We can see people who are in danger and act to help them. That\u2019s our job, not the government\u2019s.\nWe cannot and should not rely on the government to be our moral saviors. If we do so, we risk them dictating moral policy, and that is a dangerous path indeed.\nPeople who do horrible things to other people are evil. Connie Yates and Chris Gard are stealing a bunch of money from people and using it to allow a zombie baby to take up space and resources in a hospital that could be used to help someone else. That\u2019s evil.\nThey are parents and they love their child, Charlie, that I don\u2019t deny, but they have let that love become twisted into something horrible. Something that borders on, and in my opinion, crosses into a realm we call evil. Those who support them are not just enabling this situation but contributing to it.\nCharlie was born with a terrible disease that left his brain destroyed. He is unable to breath or move. He is blind and deaf. Even if the cause of this tragic disease could be treated, and it can\u2019t, his brain is dead. He is simply a lifeless zombie. I can only hope Charlie doesn\u2019t have nerve activity and he is feeling no pain. Still, there is tremendous pain being intentionally inflicted by Yates and Gard playing to people\u2019s heartstrings with the impossibility of the boy\u2019s recovery. They are stealing money from people, not for themselves, but for doctors offering an experimental treatment that will do nothing to reverse the brain damage.\nOne of the most fundamental issues of this situation is the reversal of normal morality.  If the child had a disease which can be cured, it would be despicable to place that child in the woods and allow it to die. This was done throughout history but medical care has improved to the point where children who were doomed to horrific lives until a few hundred years ago, can now live full and fulfilling lives. Thus, when we hear about a sick child whose parents are trying to get medical care, we are predisposed to think of them as heroes and those who are opposed as villains.\nIn this case it is the reverse. Keeping Charlie alive is the immoral act. The professionals at Great Ormond Street Hospital are the ethical and kind players in this story. The judges who have made their rulings are moral.\nWhat I\u2019m saying is brutal. It\u2019s not nice. I\u2019m not a nice guy. Ask anyone who knows me and they\u2019ll be happy to confirm I\u2019m often times quite a jerk, quite forceful, when it comes to putting forward arguments. Be that as it may, what I\u2019m saying is true. Keeping Charlie alive is the immoral act. That\u2019s the bottom line. The parents are engaged in behavior that I can only describe as evil.\nThere are a number of people in Social Media and other places who supported and continue to support this behavior. They encouraged the parents to take money from many people for the pursuance of an immoral act. They encouraged the people to keep poor Charlie on life-support for the last ten months when they could have ended this entire ordeal, and saved a huge amount of pain and suffering. Those who support Yates and Gard are contributing to the evil.\nIf that\u2019s you, I won\u2019t apologize. Get your act together.\n", "prompt": "A relatively famous actor named Allison Mack has been charged with sex trafficking for recruiting women to join a multi-level marketing company called NXIVM and an associated group called DOS. What is interesting about all of this is the supposed crimes were committed largely against eager and willing victims.\nWhen it comes to the idea of human trafficking, the United States is currently in the midst of a Moral Panic. Supposedly 15,000 people are so trafficked every year but there is almost no actual evidence to support this number. That hasn\u2019t stopped the government and a large number of well-meaning but largely self-deluded citizens from passing useless laws and spending hundreds of millions of dollars to combat the largely non-existent problem.\nThat\u2019s where Mack and a fellow named Keith Raniere get involved. Raniere is a despicable fellow. He runs a multi-level marketing company called NXIVM which is slightly different than others of its kind. Instead of simply bilking people of their money with barely legal promises, he also uses the company to convince women to serve as his sexual slaves. Under his charismatic control they allowed themselves to be branded with his initials in their pubic regions. Mack served as leader of a subsidiary organization that recruited women to serve sexually. DOS stands for dominus obsequious sororium which is Latin for master over the slave women.\nThere are allegations that Mack and Raniere used blackmail to keep women in NXIVM and this is against the law. The fact that women joined a group and served as sex slaves is not, much as many would like it to be, a crime.  Where there are charges of coercion and blackmail, they should be investigated.\nIf Mack was involved with blackmail she should be so charged. The problem here is we are using laws created to stop a non-existent problem to prosecute people for a particular activity we find distasteful. Something that should never have been illegal in the first place. This is a microcosm of the entire War on Drugs and also the needless traffic crimes which result in the theft of billions of dollars from citizens.\nI think it is telling when the government went to Mexico to arrest Raniere, the woman at his compound hopped into their cars and chased the police all the way to the airport trying to rescue him. They are clearly not victims here. Certainly, they are dupes and fools but they are participating in something and they eagerly want to continue to do so. The government should not be trying to prevent us from doing that which we desire, even if it isn\u2019t in our best self-interest. That is our job.\nRaniere is scum. Mack is as well. But unless they drug an unwilling victim and keep them imprisoned either physically or through blackmail, they haven\u2019t committed a crime. I know the headlines are shrieking human trafficking but that\u2019s not what happened.\nAs much as my stomach is turned by the behavior of Raniere and Mack, their freedom is my freedom. If they can be arrested for convincing someone to be a sex slave can I be arrested for convincing someone to purchase my books because the government might not like their content? It\u2019s not as big a stretch as you might imagine.\nWe must guard not only our freedom, but those who we dislike as well, particularly those whose behavior is most disturbing.\nHero or Bad Example to Save Rabbit from Fire?\nA video of a young man standing near an intense fire in California and rescuing a rabbit attempting to flee the flames has engendered a bit of controversy that I\u2019d like to examine. One group of people, apparently the majority, think he is an amazing hero while another group think he was incredibly foolish and set a terrible example.\nIt\u2019s an interesting case. If he had rushed toward the fire to save a baby would the perception be different? If he was a trained firefighter would people view his actions in a different light? The debate seems to largely center around the fact he risked his life, a human life, to save that of a common animal.\n The second group includes those of the opinion the life of the rabbit is of equal importance to that of the man; that his actions are noble in that regard. Others do not argue the life of the rabbit equivalent to that of a person but still laud his actions as heroic and worthwhile.\nA human life might well be more important than the rabbit. I think arguments can be made that given a choice between saving a human baby and saving a rabbit, the objectively correct choice would be to save the baby. Some of my more passionate animal rights friends will argue the rabbit life is perhaps of greater importance than one of the seven and a half billion people living on the planet. There are likely fewer rabbits than people.\nTo me the life of the rabbit and the life of the young rescuer are of little importance to the question. Likewise, the inspirational impact of the young man is not a primary factor I consider. To me it comes down to my Libertarian principles. He wanted to save the rabbit. He chose to do so. He was not coerced into doing so. He was successful and I think it cannot be debated his life was enriched. Perhaps he will look back on his actions with sheepish regret and realize risking his own life, and perhaps others who might have had to rescue him should he have succumbed to smoke inhalation, was not worth the risk. But, his actions reflect his clearly powerful desires of the moment.\nLet\u2019s imagine he did fall while making the attempt. That another person went to rescue him and died in the effort. The same principles I\u2019m applying to the young man work with the hypothetical rescuer. She or he chose to make the attempt. That is what being free is all about. This is the heart of the Libertarian Movement.\nThe government solution is that we must be protected from doing things that might cause us harm. I would not be surprised to see legislation arise in some states making it illegal to attempt to rescue wildlife from dangerous situations.\nIt is clear the young man put himself in danger. He might inspire others to do the same. So what? What business is it of yours, of the government\u2019s? It\u2019s his life and, as long as he\u2019s not harming others, he should be able to lead it as he chooses!\nIf you think he\u2019s a hero that\u2019s great.  The important point is that he did as he chose to do, as should we all.\nI just watched an interesting video on YouTube about pedestrian citations. Basically, pedestrians are given tickets for various violations including jaywalking and a litany of other things. The idea behind the citations is they are issued for the protection of citizens. Not crossing at a crosswalk is potentially a dangerous activity.\nWhile I\u2019m certain you won\u2019t be surprised blacks and Hispanics receive the majority of these pedestrian citations, that\u2019s not really what I want to talk about today. It\u2019s the government supposedly trying to protect us that bothers me. In reality they are simply financing themselves through citations. The reason I say this is because the studies show these tickets are often given in areas where pedestrians have little choice but to break the law.\nIn the case of Florida, where the video originated, they are often given on streets where there is no sidewalk to use and yet there are bus stops. People must get to the bus stop but they can\u2019t get there without walking on the street, which is a violation. Many other instances are when people move from one side of the street to the other but not at a crosswalk.\nWhen you examine the region, there are no crosswalks available for multiple blocks. The alternative being to walk three, four, or more blocks out of your way to cross the street. I don\u2019t care how much of a law and order person you are, that\u2019s a law no one is going to follow.\nThe reality is making the streets safer for pedestrians involves spending money on building better sidewalks, designating more crosswalks, and a variety of other things. If the government actually wanted to make us safer, that\u2019s what they\u2019d do. Citations for these sorts of silly things are merely an excuse to generate revenue for the city.\nFor example, in my state of Missouri I violate a pedestrian law on an almost daily basis by walking on the left half of a crosswalk. Code 300.385. I\u2019m fairly certain every person reading this article has violated this law many times. Because this law is violated constantly it becomes rife for abuse. The officer can charge whomever she or he feels like charging and let anyone else go merrily on their way. This is the problem with many laws and why we see people of color getting the majority of such citations, although, again, that\u2019s not my main problem here.\nThe problem is the law. Let\u2019s take 300.385 as an example of a law which continues to exist largely because of its revenue generating potential. The government will tell us the law was written to cut down on inconvenience when crossing the street at a crosswalk. By keeping opposite flowing pedestrian traffic on different sides, it is a better system. I don\u2019t disagree with the principle of the idea. It is a good strategy. It just shouldn\u2019t be a law punishable by a fine.\nIf someone wants to cross on the opposite side and there is no, or little, oncoming pedestrian traffic; all is well. If, on the other hand, the crosswalk is filled with people going both directions and someone is swimming upstream they are generally given dirty looks and even forced to the other side. That\u2019s enough punishment. We don\u2019t need to take people\u2019s money in order to get them to walk on the convenient side of the crosswalk. Are we going to have laws forcing people to wait before entering a mass transit vehicle thus allowing exiting people to go first?\nIt is against the law to change lanes without signaling. It is against the law to make a turn and switch from one lane to another while doing so. There is virtually no one in the nation who doesn\u2019t break laws on a daily basis.\nThe question I\u2019d like you to ask yourself is relatively simple. If law enforcement agents started to enforce these laws on people driving a Mercedes, a Lexus, a Tesla, a BMW, and other expensive cars; if law enforcement agents started enforcing jaywalking laws on people wearing expensive clothes; if law enforcement agents started citing politicians at the state capital for crossing on the wrong half of the crosswalk; how long before the laws would change?\nThese laws are a tool of oppression on those who cannot defend themselves and serve the sole purpose of financing government agents without making life any safer or better for citizens. That\u2019s just plain wrong.\nOne of my Facebook acquaintances who is deeply passionate about animal rights recently posted about the Lychee Dog Meat festival in China. I think it\u2019s fairly reasonable to suggest that most of us in the western world are not particularly comfortable with eating canines. What can be done about it? What is the best way to stop such behavior? This question speaks to my Libertarian ideology.\nI recently wrote several blogs about the horse meat industry and I think the comparison is reasonable. When horse lovers lobbied Congress sufficiently, laws were passed that defunded the inspection of horse slaughter houses. Because it is not legal to slaughter animals in the United States without such inspections, the industry was eliminated. Yet, the practice continues.\nThe efforts of people like my friend on Facebook are used to put pressure on China to outlaw the Lychee festival. In China manipulative legislative runarounds like that which was done with the horse meat industry are unnecessary. They do not live in a free society. If the government wants to prevent a particular activity, they simply issue a ban. There is no Constitution to maneuver around. If my friend and her allies can put enough pressure on China to outlaw the festival, it will happen, but will it work?\nIn China the government position is that the Chinese people do not hold dogs in the same regard as companions as do Westerners. They find our slaughter of cows and chickens to be far more egregious than the single festival in which a few thousand dogs die. In this, I believe they are correct. \nOpponents of the festival argue the dogs die in unsupervised, and horrific fashion. That many of the animals are stolen from their owners. I have no way of knowing if this is true or not but it certainly seems plausible.\nNow we get down to the reality of this world. The Chinese people enjoy the meat of dogs. The people of the United States largely find such slaughter abhorrent.\nLet\u2019s imagine for a moment that the Chinese government comes around the way of thinking of my friend. They ban the slaughter of dogs, they outlaw the Lychee festival. Do we think that such will prevent dogs from being slaughtered and eaten? The answer is obviously no. As long as Chinese people want to eat dogs, dogs will be eaten. Horses are still slaughtered and eaten in the United States, it is just done via a black market. The price increases, money is delivered into the hands of criminals. The ban is largely ineffective.\nIt seems obvious to me such would be the case in China. The Chinese government might even give lip service to such a ban but would not bother to enforce it. This is the problem with relying on government to solve problems. Sure, they can pass laws, they can make heroin illegal, they can make speeding illegal, they can outlaw certain variety of firearms, but these laws never stop human behavior. If people want to consume drugs, to drive quickly, to purchase firearms; they will continue to do so.\nWe only give ourselves the illusion of safety and harmony with such laws. In reality the behavior continues largely unabated or even enhanced by the lure of danger.\nWhat is to be done? My friend is passionate, she is caring, she strongly believes in the rights of animals. I applaud and admire her dedication and think it is people like her who will eventually bring about change, if change is to come. She should continue to make her opinion known, convince one person at a time. It is only when people no longer want to consume dogs, or horses, that the Lychee festival will end. The government is helpless and hopeless.\nDo not rely on government to legislate. Convince people, convince the individual. The individual has the power. If you cannot convince the people, then you need to make a better argument.\nI was thinking about the idea of an apology. You say or do something you regret. You say you\u2019re sorry. The natural reaction of the person or people you\u2019ve offended or angered is to accept the apology. It is almost as if some part, if not all, of the original transgression never happened. But what is an apology? Just words. I\u2019m beginning to become skeptical about accepting those words, they are merely a way for the person giving the apology to feel better. I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t want apologies anymore, I want to see a change in your behavior. That\u2019s a real apology. If that\u2019s beyond you, fine. Let\u2019s both move on.\nI\u2019m sure this is coming across as rather cruel and heartless and perhaps it is. It\u2019s just that I often see people giving what appears to be heartfelt apologies for particular misbehaviors and then going right back to repeating the offending behavior in exactly the same fashion.\nI\u2019m sometimes willing to believe the apology is sincere. The person does feel bad about what she or he did. But the apology is nothing more than a symptom masking panacea. The offending person is fixed and can go on about their life without further worry, until they do it again. It\u2019s an endless cycle of misbehavior and apology. There is no effort to fix the underlying problem, or perhaps there is an attempt but it ends in failure. The apology is a central part of the ongoing problem.\nIt seems to me, quite frequently the words are completely phony. The person is only apologizing because the behavior generated unfavorable results. The person isn\u2019t really sorry at all. They are sorry about the consequences but they acted exactly in the fashion they desired. The only thing they\u2019d change about the incident that requires an apology is the resulting upset.\nHowever, if the person actually changes their behavior over the course of the next several years, that would seem to me to be a real apology. I\u2019m sorry I did something and I recognize what I did was wrong. Every time I\u2019m in a situation in which I could repeat the behavior, I react differently. That\u2019s an apology I can get behind.\nSo, there you have it. If you offend me and aren\u2019t sorry. That\u2019s cool. Tell me you\u2019re not sorry and I\u2019ll deal with it. If you are sorry, change your behavior. If I offend you, tell me about it and I\u2019ll try my best to change my behavior if I feel I was in the wrong. Apologies aren\u2019t worthy of accepting or rejecting.\nSometimes I wonder why I don\u2019t have a lot of friends, then I remember!\nI\u2019ve been reading a number stories about Martha Stewart and her feelings about being imprisoned in 2004 for conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements in regards to the sale of ImClone Systems stocks. She felt it was a horrible experience and she learned nothing from it.\nI think there are a number of things to take from Stewart\u2019s opinion on this subject not the least of which is that she was convicted in what most people would regard as questionable fashion and I would classify as grossly unjust. I find her words about her imprisonment resonate strongly with me. She was not made stronger for her stay in jail, she learned nothing, she did not become a better person. It was horrible in every regard. This is an indictment of our prison system.\nFirst, I\u2019d like to talk about her conviction. She sold some stock shortly before it went down by 16% and avoided about $50,000 in losses. This may seem like a lot to you and me but to a woman of her means, it is a fairly trivial amount. Her broker supposedly was informed by an insider that a drug the company was promoting failed to gain approval. Stewart claimed there was a standard order to sell when it reached a certain price, $60, and had documentation that such an order existed.\nAn ink expert from the Secret Service testified the ink on the order for the ImClone sale was different than other ink on the document. He lied. He hadn\u2019t even examined the document. Another worker examined it and it was clear she had a grudge against Stewart. The case of securities fraud against Stewart was so flimsy the judge threw it out of court. But, Stewart insisted the order for sale at $60 was real and she was convicted on charges related to these statements. This despite the fact the person who claimed it was different ink was lying. She was not convicted of securities fraud. The civil case was eventually settled with Stewart paying the government the equivalent of triple damages although she maintained her innocence.\nSo, off she went to a minimum-security prison. Here\u2019s where her comments really caught my eye. She was asked if the sentence and imprisonment made her stronger. If the adversity was essentially good for her. This question reflects what we\u2019d like prison to be. A place where inmates reflect upon their misdeeds and emerge the better for it. No, said Stewart. It was not a learning experience. It did not make her stronger. It was horrible. It was only her own strength of character that allowed her to endure. This confirms my opinion that prison is not making better people but is largely making better criminals. It is not turning criminals into good citizens but conversely, turning good citizens into criminals.\nThis assessment is coming from an undeniably strong woman who was sent into what is largely considered the least penal sort of prison. Imagine men and women of lesser character getting sent to far worse places. We turn a young person who perhaps robbed a store, got caught with some small amount of drugs, or perhaps got into a drunken fight into a hardened criminal by sending them to our failed jails.\nIf the goal is to have a better society, to have better people, then we must listen to what Stewart has to say. If we merely want to punish people and ensure they are more likely to commit crimes after their release, then we can safely ignore Stewart\u2019s advice. It\u2019s important to note that Stewart is not merely answering a question, she is unleashing a stinging and startlingly accurate indictment of our entire system. I\u2019m not surprised, she is a woman of tremendous strength.\nIf you choose to ignore her, do so at your own peril. More and better criminals is not a recipe for a successful society.\nThere is an interesting phenomenon going on surrounding the behavior of people during the playing of the national anthem. I don\u2019t want to talk about the reason behind the kneeling but the reaction to the protests.\nThere are largely two categories of offense in these situations. Either you are affected or you are not.  The national anthem protests fall into the latter category. Blocking traffic would be the former. Your reaction to events that don\u2019t affect you is an insight into your character.\nThe stronger you are as a person the less you should react to affronts that don\u2019t affect you. If you are secure in your patriotism, why would you feel the need to force someone else into an act you deem patriotic? It is your own insecurities that rouse your ire, much more than the protest.\nBiblically, Jesus used the idea of love to demonstrate this principle. If you love yourself, you love everyone else. Their feelings toward you are irrelevant, if they hate you that is too bad but it doesn\u2019t change your opinion of them. It is only when you have feelings of doubt and insecurity in yourself that you worry what other people are thinking. Buddha and enlightenment is another example of this principle. The more secure you are in your own opinions, the less you feel it necessary to make others conform to those particular standards.\nI\u2019m certainly not criticizing anyone for standing during the national anthem but I do find their rage and urge to punish anyone who does not to be an underlying weakness of character, not a strength. If you really believed in your patriotic stance, you wouldn\u2019t need to coerce others through force, economic or social, to conform to the ideologies you hold dear. You would simply smile and be comfortable in your own behavior. Those who are secure don\u2019t need to be constantly reinforced by others. Those who are weak, who are insecure, require such reassurances.\nI\u2019m also not suggesting that such strength is easy to acquire and to demonstrate consistently. I think the ideals proposed by stories of Jesus and Buddha are essentially unobtainable, but still well worth pursuing. Everyone gets a sense of ease from being in a group of like-minded people. It is simply human nature to enjoy such comradery. When I am in a large group of people who share my ideology, I am reassured that I myself must be correct, this is a false comfort. Their agreement, or disagreement, with me has nothing to do with my own opinion.\nI don\u2019t hold myself up as a shining example of strength or perfection, but I also feel secure enough in my own beliefs that I don\u2019t attempt to forcefully make people do as I do. I\u2019m a Libertarian and an Atheist but I\u2019m not offended by Democrats or Christians. I make my points as honestly as I can and I leave the decision up to you. If you choose to believe or behave differently than me, so be it. Best of luck to you. This is strength of character.\nNot that I\u2019m telling you how to act. That\u2019s your decision, I am suggesting you look at your behavior with an eye toward critical thinking. Trying to force people into conforming to your way of doing things is a sign of tremendous weakness and insecurity, not power.\nI\u2019m lucky enough to live in the Central West End where the St. Louis Chess club is currently hosting the Sinquefield Cup and recently former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov visited the studio and joined Yasser Seirawan and Jennifer Shahade. During his chat, he essentially completely ignored Shahade both in spoken words and body language.\nIt\u2019s an interesting situation because I doubt Kasparov is misogynistic. The first reality we must take into account is that Seirawan is objectively a better chess player than Shahade. Therefore, when analyzing the various games, it was to be expected that Kasparov would rely more on the opinion of Seirawan.\n Not to say he doesn\u2019t deserve to think highly of himself, he was the best chess player in the world for a very long time and it can be argued he is the best to have ever played the game. He doesn\u2019t suffer fools lightly, as the saying goes.\nBut, even taking all of that into account, Kasparov barely even gave indication that he knew Shahade was in the room, occasionally glancing at her with his eyes but never directly addressing her or asking her any questions. He leaned toward Seirawan the entire time he was in the studio. The mood was so obvious the camera crew focused in on the two men in a tight shot for the majority of the interview.\nThe obvious conclusion we can draw is that Kasparov is misogynistic, but I\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t think he is such. Chess is a sport that is dominated by men even today, but was even more so in the era when Kasparov was world champion. It\u2019s most likely, although I am not certain, Kasparov never analyzed a single chess game in his long career with a woman.\nOf particular note is his opinion of Judit Polgar who is largely considered the best woman chess player in history. Early in her career Kasparov was asked about her potential and gave what can only be called a misogynistic statement: She has fantastic chess talent, but she is, after all, a woman. It all comes down to the imperfections of the feminine psyche. No woman can sustain a prolonged battle. Later in life, however, after he had lost a rapid game against Polgar in 2002, Kasparov revised his opinion: The Polgars showed that there are no inherent limitations to their aptitude \u2026.\nI think it\u2019s fair to say Kasparov maintains some dismissive attitudes towards women chess players and it came through, certainly unintentionally, during the interview.\n Be careful out there, people are watching!\nTeens committing suicide playing Blue Whale Challenge scream the headlines. Tenuous and often fraudulent links to people who committed suicide while supposedly playing the game immediately follow. Moral Panic sets in.\nBasically, there isn\u2019t much evidence young people are committing suicide because they were instructed to do so as part of the Blue Whale Challenge. The game supposedly involves a series of dares that occur over fifty days with the last challenge being to self-film the player\u2019s own suicide.\nFirst off, I\u2019m highly skeptical this is real. It has all the hallmarks of a hoax and the Safer Internet Centre, a European Agency, seems to think so. Secondly, I\u2019m not sure encouraging someone to kill themselves is a crime. I wrote about this in conjunction with the Michelle Carter case so I won\u2019t go on endlessly here. Providing material assistance to someone who is going to commit suicide is probably criminal. Knowing someone is attempting to commit suicide and not reporting it might be a crime. Encouraging someone to kill his or her self is despicable; but I think not criminal.\nThen there is the idea of a Moral Panic. This is basically when society learns of some danger and begins to enact laws and regulations to prevent harm from coming to its citizens. The problem is the danger never really existed at all, or was happening to such a small percentage of people that the methods enacted to prevent it actually cause more harm than the original issue.\nI argue the entire War on Drugs is a Moral Panic. Drug use causes for less damage than the interdiction methods introduced to reduce drug addiction problems. We\u2019d be far better off today if never began the War on Drugs, thus when I see something like the Blue Whale Challenge I become concerned. In the United States people are already proposing laws similar to those enacted in Russia where the Moral Panic is already in full swing.\nIn Russia, there are now laws against a website that promotes suicide and laws against encouraging a minor to commit suicide. Several people have thus far been imprisoned. I know what you\u2019re thinking, good. Those are bad things. We should have laws against them. The problem is the impact of those laws.\n I understand telling someone to kill themselves is nasty and reprehensible. I get why people want laws to prevent shameful behavior. I get children can be vulnerable to manipulation and sometimes need special protections not in place for adults. I just don\u2019t think it should be the government\u2019s responsibility to monitor this sort of thing. We can\u2019t legislate morality and the more we try, the more problems we cause.\nI can\u2019t tell you all the problems these sorts of laws might cause down the road, but I\u2019m convinced they will create more difficulties than they actually solve. These laws won\u2019t stop people from playing the Blue Whale Challenge or being administrators, if anyone actually is playing. They will just push the situation further underground.\nSome people will commit suicide. Some people will encourage others to do so because they are failed humans. We can be better friends to those in need. We can spend our time helping people, rather than hurting them. We can see people who are in danger and act to help them. That\u2019s our job, not the government\u2019s.\nWe cannot and should not rely on the government to be our moral saviors. If we do so, we risk them dictating moral policy, and that is a dangerous path indeed.\nPeople who do horrible things to other people are evil. Connie Yates and Chris Gard are stealing a bunch of money from people and using it to allow a zombie baby to take up space and resources in a hospital that could be used to help someone else. That\u2019s evil.\nThey are parents and they love their child, Charlie, that I don\u2019t deny, but they have let that love become twisted into something horrible. Something that borders on, and in my opinion, crosses into a realm we call evil. Those who support them are not just enabling this situation but contributing to it.\nCharlie was born with a terrible disease that left his brain destroyed. He is unable to breath or move. He is blind and deaf. Even if the cause of this tragic disease could be treated, and it can\u2019t, his brain is dead. He is simply a lifeless zombie. I can only hope Charlie doesn\u2019t have nerve activity and he is feeling no pain. Still, there is tremendous pain being intentionally inflicted by Yates and Gard playing to people\u2019s heartstrings with the impossibility of the boy\u2019s recovery. They are stealing money from people, not for themselves, but for doctors offering an experimental treatment that will do nothing to reverse the brain damage.\nOne of the most fundamental issues of this situation is the reversal of normal morality.  If the child had a disease which can be cured, it would be despicable to place that child in the woods and allow it to die. This was done throughout history but medical care has improved to the point where children who were doomed to horrific lives until a few hundred years ago, can now live full and fulfilling lives. Thus, when we hear about a sick child whose parents are trying to get medical care, we are predisposed to think of them as heroes and those who are opposed as villains.\nIn this case it is the reverse. Keeping Charlie alive is the immoral act. The professionals at Great Ormond Street Hospital are the ethical and kind players in this story. The judges who have made their rulings are moral.\nWhat I\u2019m saying is brutal. It\u2019s not nice. I\u2019m not a nice guy. Ask anyone who knows me and they\u2019ll be happy to confirm I\u2019m often times quite a jerk, quite forceful, when it comes to putting forward arguments. Be that as it may, what I\u2019m saying is true. Keeping Charlie alive is the immoral act. That\u2019s the bottom line. The parents are engaged in behavior that I can only describe as evil.\nThere are a number of people in Social Media and other places who supported and continue to support this behavior. They encouraged the parents to take money from many people for the pursuance of an immoral act. They encouraged the people to keep poor Charlie on life-support for the last ten months when they could have ended this entire ordeal, and saved a huge amount of pain and suffering. Those who support Yates and Gard are contributing to the evil.\nIf that\u2019s you, I won\u2019t apologize. Get your act together.\n\nWrite a 500-word creative story:", "original_prompt": "Write a 500-word creative story:", "full_output": "A relatively famous actor named Allison Mack has been charged with sex trafficking for recruiting women to join a multi-level marketing company called NXIVM and an associated group called DOS. What is interesting about all of this is the supposed crimes were committed largely against eager and willing victims.\nWhen it comes to the idea of human trafficking, the United States is currently in the midst of a Moral Panic. Supposedly 15,000 people are so trafficked every year but there is almost no actual evidence to support this number. That hasn\u2019t stopped the government and a large number of well-meaning but largely self-deluded citizens from passing useless laws and spending hundreds of millions of dollars to combat the largely non-existent problem.\nThat\u2019s where Mack and a fellow named Keith Raniere get involved. Raniere is a despicable fellow. He runs a multi-level marketing company called NXIVM which is slightly different than others of its kind. Instead of simply bilking people of their money with barely legal promises, he also uses the company to convince women to serve as his sexual slaves. Under his charismatic control they allowed themselves to be branded with his initials in their pubic regions. Mack served as leader of a subsidiary organization that recruited women to serve sexually. DOS stands for dominus obsequious sororium which is Latin for master over the slave women.\nThere are allegations that Mack and Raniere used blackmail to keep women in NXIVM and this is against the law. The fact that women joined a group and served as sex slaves is not, much as many would like it to be, a crime.  Where there are charges of coercion and blackmail, they should be investigated.\nIf Mack was involved with blackmail she should be so charged. The problem here is we are using laws created to stop a non-existent problem to prosecute people for a particular activity we find distasteful. Something that should never have been illegal in the first place. This is a microcosm of the entire War on Drugs and also the needless traffic crimes which result in the theft of billions of dollars from citizens.\nI think it is telling when the government went to Mexico to arrest Raniere, the woman at his compound hopped into their cars and chased the police all the way to the airport trying to rescue him. They are clearly not victims here. Certainly, they are dupes and fools but they are participating in something and they eagerly want to continue to do so. The government should not be trying to prevent us from doing that which we desire, even if it isn\u2019t in our best self-interest. That is our job.\nRaniere is scum. Mack is as well. But unless they drug an unwilling victim and keep them imprisoned either physically or through blackmail, they haven\u2019t committed a crime. I know the headlines are shrieking human trafficking but that\u2019s not what happened.\nAs much as my stomach is turned by the behavior of Raniere and Mack, their freedom is my freedom. If they can be arrested for convincing someone to be a sex slave can I be arrested for convincing someone to purchase my books because the government might not like their content? It\u2019s not as big a stretch as you might imagine.\nWe must guard not only our freedom, but those who we dislike as well, particularly those whose behavior is most disturbing.\nHero or Bad Example to Save Rabbit from Fire?\nA video of a young man standing near an intense fire in California and rescuing a rabbit attempting to flee the flames has engendered a bit of controversy that I\u2019d like to examine. One group of people, apparently the majority, think he is an amazing hero while another group think he was incredibly foolish and set a terrible example.\nIt\u2019s an interesting case. If he had rushed toward the fire to save a baby would the perception be different? If he was a trained firefighter would people view his actions in a different light? The debate seems to largely center around the fact he risked his life, a human life, to save that of a common animal.\n The second group includes those of the opinion the life of the rabbit is of equal importance to that of the man; that his actions are noble in that regard. Others do not argue the life of the rabbit equivalent to that of a person but still laud his actions as heroic and worthwhile.\nA human life might well be more important than the rabbit. I think arguments can be made that given a choice between saving a human baby and saving a rabbit, the objectively correct choice would be to save the baby. Some of my more passionate animal rights friends will argue the rabbit life is perhaps of greater importance than one of the seven and a half billion people living on the planet. There are likely fewer rabbits than people.\nTo me the life of the rabbit and the life of the young rescuer are of little importance to the question. Likewise, the inspirational impact of the young man is not a primary factor I consider. To me it comes down to my Libertarian principles. He wanted to save the rabbit. He chose to do so. He was not coerced into doing so. He was successful and I think it cannot be debated his life was enriched. Perhaps he will look back on his actions with sheepish regret and realize risking his own life, and perhaps others who might have had to rescue him should he have succumbed to smoke inhalation, was not worth the risk. But, his actions reflect his clearly powerful desires of the moment.\nLet\u2019s imagine he did fall while making the attempt. That another person went to rescue him and died in the effort. The same principles I\u2019m applying to the young man work with the hypothetical rescuer. She or he chose to make the attempt. That is what being free is all about. This is the heart of the Libertarian Movement.\nThe government solution is that we must be protected from doing things that might cause us harm. I would not be surprised to see legislation arise in some states making it illegal to attempt to rescue wildlife from dangerous situations.\nIt is clear the young man put himself in danger. He might inspire others to do the same. So what? What business is it of yours, of the government\u2019s? It\u2019s his life and, as long as he\u2019s not harming others, he should be able to lead it as he chooses!\nIf you think he\u2019s a hero that\u2019s great.  The important point is that he did as he chose to do, as should we all.\nI just watched an interesting video on YouTube about pedestrian citations. Basically, pedestrians are given tickets for various violations including jaywalking and a litany of other things. The idea behind the citations is they are issued for the protection of citizens. Not crossing at a crosswalk is potentially a dangerous activity.\nWhile I\u2019m certain you won\u2019t be surprised blacks and Hispanics receive the majority of these pedestrian citations, that\u2019s not really what I want to talk about today. It\u2019s the government supposedly trying to protect us that bothers me. In reality they are simply financing themselves through citations. The reason I say this is because the studies show these tickets are often given in areas where pedestrians have little choice but to break the law.\nIn the case of Florida, where the video originated, they are often given on streets where there is no sidewalk to use and yet there are bus stops. People must get to the bus stop but they can\u2019t get there without walking on the street, which is a violation. Many other instances are when people move from one side of the street to the other but not at a crosswalk.\nWhen you examine the region, there are no crosswalks available for multiple blocks. The alternative being to walk three, four, or more blocks out of your way to cross the street. I don\u2019t care how much of a law and order person you are, that\u2019s a law no one is going to follow.\nThe reality is making the streets safer for pedestrians involves spending money on building better sidewalks, designating more crosswalks, and a variety of other things. If the government actually wanted to make us safer, that\u2019s what they\u2019d do. Citations for these sorts of silly things are merely an excuse to generate revenue for the city.\nFor example, in my state of Missouri I violate a pedestrian law on an almost daily basis by walking on the left half of a crosswalk. Code 300.385. I\u2019m fairly certain every person reading this article has violated this law many times. Because this law is violated constantly it becomes rife for abuse. The officer can charge whomever she or he feels like charging and let anyone else go merrily on their way. This is the problem with many laws and why we see people of color getting the majority of such citations, although, again, that\u2019s not my main problem here.\nThe problem is the law. Let\u2019s take 300.385 as an example of a law which continues to exist largely because of its revenue generating potential. The government will tell us the law was written to cut down on inconvenience when crossing the street at a crosswalk. By keeping opposite flowing pedestrian traffic on different sides, it is a better system. I don\u2019t disagree with the principle of the idea. It is a good strategy. It just shouldn\u2019t be a law punishable by a fine.\nIf someone wants to cross on the opposite side and there is no, or little, oncoming pedestrian traffic; all is well. If, on the other hand, the crosswalk is filled with people going both directions and someone is swimming upstream they are generally given dirty looks and even forced to the other side. That\u2019s enough punishment. We don\u2019t need to take people\u2019s money in order to get them to walk on the convenient side of the crosswalk. Are we going to have laws forcing people to wait before entering a mass transit vehicle thus allowing exiting people to go first?\nIt is against the law to change lanes without signaling. It is against the law to make a turn and switch from one lane to another while doing so. There is virtually no one in the nation who doesn\u2019t break laws on a daily basis.\nThe question I\u2019d like you to ask yourself is relatively simple. If law enforcement agents started to enforce these laws on people driving a Mercedes, a Lexus, a Tesla, a BMW, and other expensive cars; if law enforcement agents started enforcing jaywalking laws on people wearing expensive clothes; if law enforcement agents started citing politicians at the state capital for crossing on the wrong half of the crosswalk; how long before the laws would change?\nThese laws are a tool of oppression on those who cannot defend themselves and serve the sole purpose of financing government agents without making life any safer or better for citizens. That\u2019s just plain wrong.\nOne of my Facebook acquaintances who is deeply passionate about animal rights recently posted about the Lychee Dog Meat festival in China. I think it\u2019s fairly reasonable to suggest that most of us in the western world are not particularly comfortable with eating canines. What can be done about it? What is the best way to stop such behavior? This question speaks to my Libertarian ideology.\nI recently wrote several blogs about the horse meat industry and I think the comparison is reasonable. When horse lovers lobbied Congress sufficiently, laws were passed that defunded the inspection of horse slaughter houses. Because it is not legal to slaughter animals in the United States without such inspections, the industry was eliminated. Yet, the practice continues.\nThe efforts of people like my friend on Facebook are used to put pressure on China to outlaw the Lychee festival. In China manipulative legislative runarounds like that which was done with the horse meat industry are unnecessary. They do not live in a free society. If the government wants to prevent a particular activity, they simply issue a ban. There is no Constitution to maneuver around. If my friend and her allies can put enough pressure on China to outlaw the festival, it will happen, but will it work?\nIn China the government position is that the Chinese people do not hold dogs in the same regard as companions as do Westerners. They find our slaughter of cows and chickens to be far more egregious than the single festival in which a few thousand dogs die. In this, I believe they are correct. \nOpponents of the festival argue the dogs die in unsupervised, and horrific fashion. That many of the animals are stolen from their owners. I have no way of knowing if this is true or not but it certainly seems plausible.\nNow we get down to the reality of this world. The Chinese people enjoy the meat of dogs. The people of the United States largely find such slaughter abhorrent.\nLet\u2019s imagine for a moment that the Chinese government comes around the way of thinking of my friend. They ban the slaughter of dogs, they outlaw the Lychee festival. Do we think that such will prevent dogs from being slaughtered and eaten? The answer is obviously no. As long as Chinese people want to eat dogs, dogs will be eaten. Horses are still slaughtered and eaten in the United States, it is just done via a black market. The price increases, money is delivered into the hands of criminals. The ban is largely ineffective.\nIt seems obvious to me such would be the case in China. The Chinese government might even give lip service to such a ban but would not bother to enforce it. This is the problem with relying on government to solve problems. Sure, they can pass laws, they can make heroin illegal, they can make speeding illegal, they can outlaw certain variety of firearms, but these laws never stop human behavior. If people want to consume drugs, to drive quickly, to purchase firearms; they will continue to do so.\nWe only give ourselves the illusion of safety and harmony with such laws. In reality the behavior continues largely unabated or even enhanced by the lure of danger.\nWhat is to be done? My friend is passionate, she is caring, she strongly believes in the rights of animals. I applaud and admire her dedication and think it is people like her who will eventually bring about change, if change is to come. She should continue to make her opinion known, convince one person at a time. It is only when people no longer want to consume dogs, or horses, that the Lychee festival will end. The government is helpless and hopeless.\nDo not rely on government to legislate. Convince people, convince the individual. The individual has the power. If you cannot convince the people, then you need to make a better argument.\nI was thinking about the idea of an apology. You say or do something you regret. You say you\u2019re sorry. The natural reaction of the person or people you\u2019ve offended or angered is to accept the apology. It is almost as if some part, if not all, of the original transgression never happened. But what is an apology? Just words. I\u2019m beginning to become skeptical about accepting those words, they are merely a way for the person giving the apology to feel better. I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t want apologies anymore, I want to see a change in your behavior. That\u2019s a real apology. If that\u2019s beyond you, fine. Let\u2019s both move on.\nI\u2019m sure this is coming across as rather cruel and heartless and perhaps it is. It\u2019s just that I often see people giving what appears to be heartfelt apologies for particular misbehaviors and then going right back to repeating the offending behavior in exactly the same fashion.\nI\u2019m sometimes willing to believe the apology is sincere. The person does feel bad about what she or he did. But the apology is nothing more than a symptom masking panacea. The offending person is fixed and can go on about their life without further worry, until they do it again. It\u2019s an endless cycle of misbehavior and apology. There is no effort to fix the underlying problem, or perhaps there is an attempt but it ends in failure. The apology is a central part of the ongoing problem.\nIt seems to me, quite frequently the words are completely phony. The person is only apologizing because the behavior generated unfavorable results. The person isn\u2019t really sorry at all. They are sorry about the consequences but they acted exactly in the fashion they desired. The only thing they\u2019d change about the incident that requires an apology is the resulting upset.\nHowever, if the person actually changes their behavior over the course of the next several years, that would seem to me to be a real apology. I\u2019m sorry I did something and I recognize what I did was wrong. Every time I\u2019m in a situation in which I could repeat the behavior, I react differently. That\u2019s an apology I can get behind.\nSo, there you have it. If you offend me and aren\u2019t sorry. That\u2019s cool. Tell me you\u2019re not sorry and I\u2019ll deal with it. If you are sorry, change your behavior. If I offend you, tell me about it and I\u2019ll try my best to change my behavior if I feel I was in the wrong. Apologies aren\u2019t worthy of accepting or rejecting.\nSometimes I wonder why I don\u2019t have a lot of friends, then I remember!\nI\u2019ve been reading a number stories about Martha Stewart and her feelings about being imprisoned in 2004 for conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements in regards to the sale of ImClone Systems stocks. She felt it was a horrible experience and she learned nothing from it.\nI think there are a number of things to take from Stewart\u2019s opinion on this subject not the least of which is that she was convicted in what most people would regard as questionable fashion and I would classify as grossly unjust. I find her words about her imprisonment resonate strongly with me. She was not made stronger for her stay in jail, she learned nothing, she did not become a better person. It was horrible in every regard. This is an indictment of our prison system.\nFirst, I\u2019d like to talk about her conviction. She sold some stock shortly before it went down by 16% and avoided about $50,000 in losses. This may seem like a lot to you and me but to a woman of her means, it is a fairly trivial amount. Her broker supposedly was informed by an insider that a drug the company was promoting failed to gain approval. Stewart claimed there was a standard order to sell when it reached a certain price, $60, and had documentation that such an order existed.\nAn ink expert from the Secret Service testified the ink on the order for the ImClone sale was different than other ink on the document. He lied. He hadn\u2019t even examined the document. Another worker examined it and it was clear she had a grudge against Stewart. The case of securities fraud against Stewart was so flimsy the judge threw it out of court. But, Stewart insisted the order for sale at $60 was real and she was convicted on charges related to these statements. This despite the fact the person who claimed it was different ink was lying. She was not convicted of securities fraud. The civil case was eventually settled with Stewart paying the government the equivalent of triple damages although she maintained her innocence.\nSo, off she went to a minimum-security prison. Here\u2019s where her comments really caught my eye. She was asked if the sentence and imprisonment made her stronger. If the adversity was essentially good for her. This question reflects what we\u2019d like prison to be. A place where inmates reflect upon their misdeeds and emerge the better for it. No, said Stewart. It was not a learning experience. It did not make her stronger. It was horrible. It was only her own strength of character that allowed her to endure. This confirms my opinion that prison is not making better people but is largely making better criminals. It is not turning criminals into good citizens but conversely, turning good citizens into criminals.\nThis assessment is coming from an undeniably strong woman who was sent into what is largely considered the least penal sort of prison. Imagine men and women of lesser character getting sent to far worse places. We turn a young person who perhaps robbed a store, got caught with some small amount of drugs, or perhaps got into a drunken fight into a hardened criminal by sending them to our failed jails.\nIf the goal is to have a better society, to have better people, then we must listen to what Stewart has to say. If we merely want to punish people and ensure they are more likely to commit crimes after their release, then we can safely ignore Stewart\u2019s advice. It\u2019s important to note that Stewart is not merely answering a question, she is unleashing a stinging and startlingly accurate indictment of our entire system. I\u2019m not surprised, she is a woman of tremendous strength.\nIf you choose to ignore her, do so at your own peril. More and better criminals is not a recipe for a successful society.\nThere is an interesting phenomenon going on surrounding the behavior of people during the playing of the national anthem. I don\u2019t want to talk about the reason behind the kneeling but the reaction to the protests.\nThere are largely two categories of offense in these situations. Either you are affected or you are not.  The national anthem protests fall into the latter category. Blocking traffic would be the former. Your reaction to events that don\u2019t affect you is an insight into your character.\nThe stronger you are as a person the less you should react to affronts that don\u2019t affect you. If you are secure in your patriotism, why would you feel the need to force someone else into an act you deem patriotic? It is your own insecurities that rouse your ire, much more than the protest.\nBiblically, Jesus used the idea of love to demonstrate this principle. If you love yourself, you love everyone else. Their feelings toward you are irrelevant, if they hate you that is too bad but it doesn\u2019t change your opinion of them. It is only when you have feelings of doubt and insecurity in yourself that you worry what other people are thinking. Buddha and enlightenment is another example of this principle. The more secure you are in your own opinions, the less you feel it necessary to make others conform to those particular standards.\nI\u2019m certainly not criticizing anyone for standing during the national anthem but I do find their rage and urge to punish anyone who does not to be an underlying weakness of character, not a strength. If you really believed in your patriotic stance, you wouldn\u2019t need to coerce others through force, economic or social, to conform to the ideologies you hold dear. You would simply smile and be comfortable in your own behavior. Those who are secure don\u2019t need to be constantly reinforced by others. Those who are weak, who are insecure, require such reassurances.\nI\u2019m also not suggesting that such strength is easy to acquire and to demonstrate consistently. I think the ideals proposed by stories of Jesus and Buddha are essentially unobtainable, but still well worth pursuing. Everyone gets a sense of ease from being in a group of like-minded people. It is simply human nature to enjoy such comradery. When I am in a large group of people who share my ideology, I am reassured that I myself must be correct, this is a false comfort. Their agreement, or disagreement, with me has nothing to do with my own opinion.\nI don\u2019t hold myself up as a shining example of strength or perfection, but I also feel secure enough in my own beliefs that I don\u2019t attempt to forcefully make people do as I do. I\u2019m a Libertarian and an Atheist but I\u2019m not offended by Democrats or Christians. I make my points as honestly as I can and I leave the decision up to you. If you choose to believe or behave differently than me, so be it. Best of luck to you. This is strength of character.\nNot that I\u2019m telling you how to act. That\u2019s your decision, I am suggesting you look at your behavior with an eye toward critical thinking. Trying to force people into conforming to your way of doing things is a sign of tremendous weakness and insecurity, not power.\nI\u2019m lucky enough to live in the Central West End where the St. Louis Chess club is currently hosting the Sinquefield Cup and recently former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov visited the studio and joined Yasser Seirawan and Jennifer Shahade. During his chat, he essentially completely ignored Shahade both in spoken words and body language.\nIt\u2019s an interesting situation because I doubt Kasparov is misogynistic. The first reality we must take into account is that Seirawan is objectively a better chess player than Shahade. Therefore, when analyzing the various games, it was to be expected that Kasparov would rely more on the opinion of Seirawan.\n Not to say he doesn\u2019t deserve to think highly of himself, he was the best chess player in the world for a very long time and it can be argued he is the best to have ever played the game. He doesn\u2019t suffer fools lightly, as the saying goes.\nBut, even taking all of that into account, Kasparov barely even gave indication that he knew Shahade was in the room, occasionally glancing at her with his eyes but never directly addressing her or asking her any questions. He leaned toward Seirawan the entire time he was in the studio. The mood was so obvious the camera crew focused in on the two men in a tight shot for the majority of the interview.\nThe obvious conclusion we can draw is that Kasparov is misogynistic, but I\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t think he is such. Chess is a sport that is dominated by men even today, but was even more so in the era when Kasparov was world champion. It\u2019s most likely, although I am not certain, Kasparov never analyzed a single chess game in his long career with a woman.\nOf particular note is his opinion of Judit Polgar who is largely considered the best woman chess player in history. Early in her career Kasparov was asked about her potential and gave what can only be called a misogynistic statement: She has fantastic chess talent, but she is, after all, a woman. It all comes down to the imperfections of the feminine psyche. No woman can sustain a prolonged battle. Later in life, however, after he had lost a rapid game against Polgar in 2002, Kasparov revised his opinion: The Polgars showed that there are no inherent limitations to their aptitude \u2026.\nI think it\u2019s fair to say Kasparov maintains some dismissive attitudes towards women chess players and it came through, certainly unintentionally, during the interview.\n Be careful out there, people are watching!\nTeens committing suicide playing Blue Whale Challenge scream the headlines. Tenuous and often fraudulent links to people who committed suicide while supposedly playing the game immediately follow. Moral Panic sets in.\nBasically, there isn\u2019t much evidence young people are committing suicide because they were instructed to do so as part of the Blue Whale Challenge. The game supposedly involves a series of dares that occur over fifty days with the last challenge being to self-film the player\u2019s own suicide.\nFirst off, I\u2019m highly skeptical this is real. It has all the hallmarks of a hoax and the Safer Internet Centre, a European Agency, seems to think so. Secondly, I\u2019m not sure encouraging someone to kill themselves is a crime. I wrote about this in conjunction with the Michelle Carter case so I won\u2019t go on endlessly here. Providing material assistance to someone who is going to commit suicide is probably criminal. Knowing someone is attempting to commit suicide and not reporting it might be a crime. Encouraging someone to kill his or her self is despicable; but I think not criminal.\nThen there is the idea of a Moral Panic. This is basically when society learns of some danger and begins to enact laws and regulations to prevent harm from coming to its citizens. The problem is the danger never really existed at all, or was happening to such a small percentage of people that the methods enacted to prevent it actually cause more harm than the original issue.\nI argue the entire War on Drugs is a Moral Panic. Drug use causes for less damage than the interdiction methods introduced to reduce drug addiction problems. We\u2019d be far better off today if never began the War on Drugs, thus when I see something like the Blue Whale Challenge I become concerned. In the United States people are already proposing laws similar to those enacted in Russia where the Moral Panic is already in full swing.\nIn Russia, there are now laws against a website that promotes suicide and laws against encouraging a minor to commit suicide. Several people have thus far been imprisoned. I know what you\u2019re thinking, good. Those are bad things. We should have laws against them. The problem is the impact of those laws.\n I understand telling someone to kill themselves is nasty and reprehensible. I get why people want laws to prevent shameful behavior. I get children can be vulnerable to manipulation and sometimes need special protections not in place for adults. I just don\u2019t think it should be the government\u2019s responsibility to monitor this sort of thing. We can\u2019t legislate morality and the more we try, the more problems we cause.\nI can\u2019t tell you all the problems these sorts of laws might cause down the road, but I\u2019m convinced they will create more difficulties than they actually solve. These laws won\u2019t stop people from playing the Blue Whale Challenge or being administrators, if anyone actually is playing. They will just push the situation further underground.\nSome people will commit suicide. Some people will encourage others to do so because they are failed humans. We can be better friends to those in need. We can spend our time helping people, rather than hurting them. We can see people who are in danger and act to help them. That\u2019s our job, not the government\u2019s.\nWe cannot and should not rely on the government to be our moral saviors. If we do so, we risk them dictating moral policy, and that is a dangerous path indeed.\nPeople who do horrible things to other people are evil. Connie Yates and Chris Gard are stealing a bunch of money from people and using it to allow a zombie baby to take up space and resources in a hospital that could be used to help someone else. That\u2019s evil.\nThey are parents and they love their child, Charlie, that I don\u2019t deny, but they have let that love become twisted into something horrible. Something that borders on, and in my opinion, crosses into a realm we call evil. Those who support them are not just enabling this situation but contributing to it.\nCharlie was born with a terrible disease that left his brain destroyed. He is unable to breath or move. He is blind and deaf. Even if the cause of this tragic disease could be treated, and it can\u2019t, his brain is dead. He is simply a lifeless zombie. I can only hope Charlie doesn\u2019t have nerve activity and he is feeling no pain. Still, there is tremendous pain being intentionally inflicted by Yates and Gard playing to people\u2019s heartstrings with the impossibility of the boy\u2019s recovery. They are stealing money from people, not for themselves, but for doctors offering an experimental treatment that will do nothing to reverse the brain damage.\nOne of the most fundamental issues of this situation is the reversal of normal morality.  If the child had a disease which can be cured, it would be despicable to place that child in the woods and allow it to die. This was done throughout history but medical care has improved to the point where children who were doomed to horrific lives until a few hundred years ago, can now live full and fulfilling lives. Thus, when we hear about a sick child whose parents are trying to get medical care, we are predisposed to think of them as heroes and those who are opposed as villains.\nIn this case it is the reverse. Keeping Charlie alive is the immoral act. The professionals at Great Ormond Street Hospital are the ethical and kind players in this story. The judges who have made their rulings are moral.\nWhat I\u2019m saying is brutal. It\u2019s not nice. I\u2019m not a nice guy. Ask anyone who knows me and they\u2019ll be happy to confirm I\u2019m often times quite a jerk, quite forceful, when it comes to putting forward arguments. Be that as it may, what I\u2019m saying is true. Keeping Charlie alive is the immoral act. That\u2019s the bottom line. The parents are engaged in behavior that I can only describe as evil.\nThere are a number of people in Social Media and other places who supported and continue to support this behavior. They encouraged the parents to take money from many people for the pursuance of an immoral act. They encouraged the people to keep poor Charlie on life-support for the last ten months when they could have ended this entire ordeal, and saved a huge amount of pain and suffering. Those who support Yates and Gard are contributing to the evil.\nIf that\u2019s you, I won\u2019t apologize. Get your act together.\n\nWrite a 500-word creative story: He to the \u201cto the the to the to that, he to that, and they, there is, to the to the to be, then to the to the to be to the to this to the to be, they are to the to the to the to him to be to the to them to the to the to do to be to make to the \u201cthat to the to most?

With a 5-inch display, the LePad S2005 unfortunately sports the same WVGA resolution that the Dell Streak was initially released with, rather than the newer higher resolution 1280 X 800 display screen on the 5.3-inch Samsung Galaxy Note.

Away from the sporting field, Sarah pursues her passion for inspiring young people to excel as she works tirelessly to support the next generation.\nAn exciting future lies ahead for the Black Ferns XVs and Sevens teams, made up of New Zealand\u2019s premier and elite female players. The next 18 months will see the teams competing on the world stage in both formats of rugby as they continue on their journey to greatness.\nRecognising the uncompromising spirit and bold nature of the sport, Tudor has decided to partner with World Rugby and New Zealand Rugby through the All Blacks and Black Ferns XVs and Sevens teams. As rugby continues to grow globally and with 2.7 million women and girls now playing the sport, Tudor will be celebrating the daring nature of the world\u2019s best female players, highlighting the dedication and commitment that allows them to prosper both on and off the field of play.\nHirini is now part of that elite team that Tudor has built. When not training or playing competitively, Hirini can be seen hitting the waves indulging in her other favourite sport, surfing. She also loves hitting the great outdoors with husband Conor Hirini and their dog Booker. Hirini tackles the questions Options asked her via email.\nWhy did you choose rugby?\nI play rugby because I love the game, but also because of the people I\u2019ve been able to meet and who\u2019ve become pretty much family.\nWhat did you look for when you agreed to become a Tudor brand ambassador?\nFor me, when I partner with a brand, it\u2019s really important they have the same values as I do. With Tudor, it was also the opportunity of working with them to help grow the women\u2019s game around the world. I\u2019d seen the support they were already providing the game and I wanted to be a part of that.\nWhat is it about the Tudor brand that resonates with you?\nTudor\u2019s daring attitude and spirit and their focus on high performance and supporting the women\u2019s game.\nWhat does the term \u2018Born to Dare\u2019 mean to you?\nBorn to Dare to me means having a daring spirit, taking those opportunities and not being afraid to go outside the norms when you believe in something.\nHow are you going to use your fan base and Tudor\u2019s platform to be a role model?\nTudor believes in and supports the women\u2019s game. I\u2019m looking forward to working alongside Tudor to develop and grow the game globally.\nSince you started playing rugby professionally there have been younger girls who look up to you, what are some of the messages you want to tell them?\nI want them to just give it a go. When you\u2019re passionate about something and put effort into it, magical things can happen. Being happy in everything that they do is also so important.\nWhich one (or more) of Tudor\u2019s collection is your favourite and why?\nThe new Black Bay Ceramic is a favourite of mine. It is a beautiful black design with a high-performance movement that works for casual or for- mal occasions. I love its natural versatility and robustness, and it allows me to enjoy my lifestyle by the beach and out surfing.\nJust as you have looked up to those women trailblazers who went before you. Can you share who are some of your role models?\nBlack Ferns legend and veteran Farah Palmer was always someone I looked up to ever since I first began playing rugby. Her values and leadership style were inspirational along with her mana on and off the field. My sister is also a big inspiration to me. She plays in the National provincial competition for her local Manawatu\u0301 region, training before and after work while also raising two young children.\nWhat do awards and accolades mean to you?\nIt\u2019s always special to receive recognition for the work done on and off the field, but my successes are also my teammates and management. We all work together to achieve these results and without them I couldn\u2019t do what I do.\nWhat was your childhood like? How did it shape the person you are today?\nMy childhood was amazing spent on the farm with my Mum, Dad and siblings. We were always busy but we had the freedom to roam the hills, ride horses and motorbikes so I\u2019m very thankful for that.\nWhat would you say to the young men and women who are looking to play rugby professionally?\nHave fun and enjoy the journey, it goes so quickly, you don\u2019t want to miss anything along the way. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask heaps of questions, it\u2019s so important when you don\u2019t know the answer.\nWhat is 2022 looking like for you?\n2022 is going to be a big year for women\u2019s rugby and a really exciting one. We have pinnacle events on the sporting calendar: Two Rugby World Cups supported by Tudor (Rugby World Cup Sevens and Rugby World Cup XV) and the Commonwealth Games that will be played alongside the World Rugby Sevens Series.\nThe Rugby World Cup XV is being hosted for the first time at home on New Zealand soil which is really exciting to be able to play in front of our family and friends and have the support of New Zealand.\nTested by the Federal Institute of Metrology (METAS), this Black Bay model is the epitome of style meeting function with its matt black ceramic elements and black Manufacture Calibre that accentuate the Black Bay Ceramic\u2019s outstanding performance.\nThe Black Bay Ceramic model has undergone numerous tests to obtain a Master Chronometer certification that requires a substantial number of changes to the Tudor Manufacture Calibre. This means that Tudor will be able to offer accreditation by an independent body, confirming the excellent quality of its watches.\nPowering the Black Bay Ceramic is the Calibre MT5602-1U that displays hour, minute and seconds functions. It has the finish typical of Tudor Manufacture Calibres but this time it is entirely in black, in line with the general appearance of the watch. Another feature to note is the \u201cweekend-proof\u201d function, this enables the wearer to take the watch off on a Friday evening and put it back on again on Monday morning without having to wind it.\nLike other models in the Black Bay range, the Ceramic is recognisable through Tudor\u2019s characteristic angular hands known as \u201cSnowflake\u201d that appeared in the brand\u2019s 1969 catalogue.\n", "prompt": "It was a bittersweet moment for Sarah Hirini when she led her team, the Black Ferns Sevens to victory when they beat France 26\u201312 in the Tokyo Olympics earlier this year.

If the wretches are unwilling to do anything about the head of Militia, they can't do anything about the head of Militia,\" said Costoria as if he was about to spit out something.\nIf the scourge is not willing to do anything, there is no way to deal with the head of Militia.\nThe wretches are really selfish,\" he said. They don't work for Ewezeino at all.\nThat's not your line,\" he said.\nI'm willing to do things I don't want to do,\" she said proudly.\nI'm reluctant to do things I don't want to do,\" she said proudly.\nIs that what you do with the magazine?\"\n\nThe craving of the Coastria is envy, jealousy, and envy. It is probably due to a sense of inferiority. Simply put, they don't like themselves. It's a nod to the fact that they don't want to be perfect.\nThat's why he was angry when I crushed his artificial eye.\nI guess it is because he hates himself that he cherishes his artificial eye, which is a part of his body that is not himself.\nI can feel envy for that.\nBut with the \"Filling Demon Bullet Cell,\" I can regain only the power of my perfect body without becoming me.\nYou don't want your body, but you want your power.\n\nSo, this is all on your own, is it?\nSurely Naga would not have meddled in the world of magic bullets. She is not the kind of person who would leave her sister alone. He probably came out alone, without telling anyone.\nWhat would he do if he got his powers back?\n\"Kill someone you don't like. The head of Militia, for example.\nWith his legs lifted in the air, Costoria falls silent.\n...... a little bit of .......\"\nShe mumbles softly.\nI just wondered if ...... it would change things a little. ......\nShe turned her head and said in a small voice, without making eye contact with him.\nThe most important thing to remember is that you can't just go against the grain.

I thought I could get a higher feeling than just 'Suck it up.\nIt's a small concern compared to the power I've gained.\nWith a miffed look on his face, he raised his voice.\nI'm saying you have too much power. If you were only as strong as a man, you wouldn't have had to go to such great lengths to find yourself.\nI suppose you don't.\"\nSlowly, I lower her to the ground. I let go of her hand, and she puts her free foot on the ground.\nShe looked me straight in the face with the artificial eye she cherished.\nShe asked me, as if asking me if I was okay or not.\nI'll go with you in your search for the Zonaid. In exchange, I will accompany you in your search for yourself.\nWrite a 500-word creative story:", "original_prompt": "Write a 500-word creative story:", "full_output": "The Sixth Erenesia base was half destroyed.\nI jump up high and land on top of the tree ship Ioneia, which crushes the base. Using the magical power of the Two Laws Sword, I stomp down on the earth.\nThe trees in the sea of trees began to grow branches and invade the gaps between the half-destroyed base.\nSensing the magical power of the Maguns, they cover the base with branches to isolate it.\nWithout a great deal of power, they would not be able to resist with this.\nHe manipulates a tree and moves Voyager on a branch in front of him.\nWith a startled look on his face, he turned his gaze toward us.\nShifting his mask slightly, I say, \"This should prove that I'm not the enemy.\n'This should prove that I'm not the enemy.\nThe first time I saw him, I was surprised to learn that he was a former member of the reincarnation world of Militia.\nThe head of the reincarnated world of Militia is a two-state pretender. No wonder he can cross paths with Isak the Calamitous. ......\nIn fact, he is not, but there is no need to explain everything here.\nI would rather you think so.\nNo one else knows who I am.\n............ certainly, if it were known, the former head of Militia would be forced out of his position. ......\nThe Two Laws Pretender is hostile to Pablo Hetala.\nIt is easier to get voyeurism than to speak as the former head of Militia. From his point of view, if he has my weakness, he won't have to worry about being betrayed.\nNow that you've turned your attention to Elenesia, do you intend to avenge Grand Admiral Gigi?\nI don't know yet. I don't know yet. I'm sure they have their own reasons.\nVoyager stared at me, as if trying to figure out my true intentions.\nIf you don't want to help us, we won't force you to do so. This is a battle of righteousness, not profit. If you can do it with your own hands, so much the better.\nVoyager gritted his back teeth.\n\"As you can ...... see, we're not strong enough,...... and even with all of our strength, we're not even close to taking down this base,.......\nProbably, the success rate is about 30%.\nThe most important thing to remember is that you can't afford to miss out on anything.\nFor them, there was no point in simply staying alive.\nFor the sake of our departed Lord and our souls, we must win this war by any means necessary. It is an offer we cannot wish for. The two presumptuous ones. Lend me your strength.\"\nHe said, \"Ah. By the way--\"\nAs I said this, I put on my mask again.\nWere you planning to go to the First Eresiania on the ship you took from this base?\nNo. The ship to First Eresia would have been shot down by the Abyssal General Army if it had not been a legitimate flight. We intend to infiltrate the central airfield and sneak onto a ship bound for First Eresia.\nAs expected, he was not that reckless.\nThen why raid this base?\"\n\"...... we don't have enough forces. Therefore, it is imperative that we have help. If we have enough strength left to overrun this base, there is someone who is willing to talk to us.\nHmmm. We are being watched closely.\nThese collaborators must be much higher in rank than Voyager and the others.\n\"Not from the world of magic bullets, huh?\n\"No, I'm not from the Magic Bullet World. There was a possibility that they might not be able to join us due to circumstances.\nJust as Voyager was about to say that, a black line ran through the sea of trees in Ioneilia. A girl with a parasol in her hand soared through the trees and into the sky.\nI know the sound of her irritated voice and her deadly presence.\nIt's hard to say, but it's certainly the best the resistance could get.\nVoyager. Why did you hide the two lawful pretenders from us?\"\nThere was the lion of destruction of Artsenon, the Coastria.\nVoyager was frightened by the bare killing intent.\nShe is threatening to strike at any moment, threatening with her enormous magical power.\nI wasn't hiding ......\nI don't want to hear your excuses.\"\nIn an instant, Costoria closes her parasol and throws it at Voyager's face.\nVoyager's as lively as ever.\"\nThe tip of the parasol comes right up to Voyager's nose, and then stops. I grab it.\n\"What a coincidence, Coetzee.\"\nYour name!\u3000You haven't changed!\nThe Costoria, now on the ground, comes at me angrily.\nHe was still expecting me to think? Did you still expect me to think?\nI didn't! It can't be helped. I'll think about it now. Right. .......\"\nDon't even think about it!\"\nHe kicked out, and I lightly caught it.\nIn the aftermath, two of the trees on the tree boat burst apart.\nVoyager gulped down a mouthful of spit, dripping with greasy sweat. He must have thought that I and Coastria had started fighting as soon as we met.\nDon't worry so much, Voyager. We call each other \"Coetzee\" and \"Pretender.\nI never called him Coetzee!\u3000Don't call me that like we're friends.\nParticles of magic power rise up from all parts of the Coast Guardia.\nVoyager braced himself.\nNo, I'm just messing with you,\" he said. A beast doesn't know how to control its power.\nWith that remark, I lifted the Coast Guardia's leg and lifted her into the air.\n\"Hey, which one of you is it?\nWhat are you doing here, Coetzee? You're not just siding with the literati because you like the way they feel about you, are you?\nLet me go first. And give me back my parasol.\nWith his prosthetic eyes, Costoria stares at me.\nYou ran to me as soon as you escaped from the Pablohetara,\" he said. You're not that stubborn, are you?\nIt was just a whim.\nTheir souls are not so cheap that you can help them on a whim.\nI don't know the price of souls. Give me my parasol.\nI held out the parasol and she took it.\nHow's your leg?\nIt's all right. I can't go on with my story if she gets out of control again.\nShe was looking at me with a disapproving glare, but she was quiet, as if she thought she would be pushed around this time if she got out of line.\nMy purpose is to create a magic tool, the 'Fama Danzo,' which will be inherited by the head of the world of magic bullets.\nThat's new news.\n\"The Filling Demon Ammunition has the power to completely compensate for any lack of power. It is said to be made from the power of the divine demon archer Audus, or a part of him.\nI don't want to say any more.\nYou were captured by the Pablohetara, and Naga came to rescue you, didn't he?\nCorstoria falls silent.\n'Yes, but that's not what I meant.\nAccording to Ottrulu's reading, the escape of Bovonga and Costoria involved someone inside Pablohetara.\nI thought that the soft-spoken Costoria might mention that someone other than Naga had come to their rescue, but he didn't say.\nWell, that's okay.

Allegedly, after LabMD refused to purchase the company\u2019s security products, it reported the alleged data security vulnerability to the FTC. The FTC accused LabMD of unfair practices in failing to provide reasonable and appropriate security for customers\u2019 personal information, which was allegedly likely to cause harm to customers. In 2015, an Administrative Law Judge dismissed the case, finding that the FTC failed to prove LabMD\u2019s practices were likely to cause substantial customer injury. In July 2016, upon appeal to the full Commission, the FTC reversed the ALJ decision. Although LabMD stopped operating in 2014, the FTC nevertheless ordered LabMD to implement several information security compliance measures because the Lab still maintains medical records. LabMD appealed to the Eleventh Circuit and filed a motion to stay the FTC\u2019s order.\nFinding that LabMD is likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal and that LabMD would be irreparably harmed by enforcement, the Eleventh Circuit granted LabMD\u2019s motion for a stay of the FTC order. Even with Chevron deference to the FTC\u2019s judgment, the court held that LabMD would likely succeed on the merits because there are \u201ccompelling reasons why the FTC\u2019s interpretation may not be reasonable.\u201d The court found that it was \u201cnot clear\u201d that 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45 could reasonably be read to cover intangible harms like the ones cited by the FTC or that \u201clikely to cause\u201d in the statute could reasonably \u201cinclude something that has a low likelihood.\u201d As to irreparable injury, the court found that the cost of complying would be detrimental to LabMD, and even if LabMD ultimately prevailed, it would not be able to recover the costs from the FTC due to sovereign immunity.

Once he knew where the secret society was, he sent one of his most trusted warriors to find out more information. The warrior made it into the secret society's camp and discovered that the members of the secret society were not like the king's people at all. They weren't greedy or cruel; they were kind and generous. They shared everything they had with each other and even helped others outside the society. The warrior was so impressed by their kindness and generosity that he decided to change sides. He told Soren about the secret society and gave him a copy of their code. Soren immediately took the code and used it to corrupt the minds of his army, forcing them to steal from everyone, including each other. The society was not unaffected by this. One of the members was able to use her magic to find out what had happened. She immediately started trying to reverse the spell. She knew she didn't have enough power to do it by herself, so she called on the help of all the other members of the secret society. Together, they were able to reverse the spell and bring back everyone's original kindness. They didn't want to take control over the king's army, though. They just wanted to teach him a lesson. They went back to the evil king's palace and offered to teach him about kindness and generosity.", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 26, "avg_token_entropy": 1.3305874080657962, "avg_token_perplexity": 5.729971719962569, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

We have integrated the latest research evidence with a holistic understanding of healthcare learned from our Indigenous custodians,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018We have affirmed the quality of rural clinicians and the collegiality, courage and creativity of rural people, even in the face of natural disasters and persisting inequities of access to healthcare, particularly for those who live in remote Australia.\nAfter Professor Worley\u2019s departure, the office will be made permanent and its remit broadened, with a new commissioner expected to begin in the role this week.\nNew deputy commissioners will be appointed to cover areas such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, nursing and allied health.\n\u2018[The role will] maintain the confidence of vulnerable rural communities facing doctor shortages and higher burden of disease,\u2019 Minister Coulton said.\nThe Federal Government announced a $550 million rural health package in 2018, including incentives for doctors and nurses to go rural, five new medical schools in the Murray\u2013Darling region, and streamlined general practice training.\nThe nationwide rollout of telehealth to help combat COVID-19 has also been a boon to rural and regional people who can find it hard to access healthcare.\n\u2018The rapid reforms we\u2019ve made to telehealth due to COVID-19 demonstrate the opportunity to better utilise technology and connectivity when it comes to healthcare delivery and medical training,\u2019 Minister Coulton said.\nNice to see some rapprochement between RACGP & ACRRM. It is quite timely as General Practice is rapidly collecting more enemies than friends at the moment.\nWrite a 500-word creative story: it can be inspired from news, imaginative, or humorous.

Seriously, go play around with the FanGraphs leaderboards for pitching over the last four seasons combined. (Or, better yet, don\u2019t do that and maintain some semblance of sanity.) No matter how you sort those numbers, from 2015 to 2018 the Reds haven\u2019t just had the worst pitching staff in all of baseball\u2014no other team has been particularly close.\nAfter yet another last place finish behind a terrible pitching staff, Reds owner Bob Castellini famously declared during the off-season that the team was going to \u201cget the pitching.\u201d And get the pitching they did, as management acquired three new starters who gave fans at least some measure of hope for 2019.\nThrough 21 games, those pitchers have been one of the better staffs in baseball. But two of them\u2014one holdover from the last couple of years and one newcomer\u2014have been so good that it\u2019s allowing me to dream a little about a one-two punch at the top of the Reds starting rotation that could be among the best in baseball for the foreseeable future. I\u2019m talking, of course, about Luis Castillo and Sonny Gray, both of whom been outstanding so far this season.\nCastillo takes the mound in San Diego tonight sporting a 1.46 ERA, 2.33 FIP and a 33.3% strikeout rate, and the metrics fueling those numbers suggest staying power. He\u2019s all over the Statcast starting pitching leaderboards: Second in whiff-per-swing rate, third in ground-ball rate, 13th in hard-hit rate, and he\u2019s yet to permit a single barrel (the most potent batted ball based on exit velocity and launch angle), let alone a home run.\nPut all those factors together, and Castillo has looked like one of MLB\u2019s best starters out of the gate. In fact, Statcast\u2019s expected weighted on-base average (xwOBA, based on quality of contact and strikeouts) places Castillo second behind reigning American League Cy Young winner Blake Snell.\nCastillo did give up his first homer of the season in that start in San Diego, but nothing else changed; he was still brilliant, allowing just one run on four hits and a walk, striking out nine over six strong innings. And if you glossed over all the nerd numbers above, permit me to simplify things for you: By almost any metric, Castillo has been perhaps the best starting pitcher in the National League.\nHow has he gotten out to such a strong start? Castillo is still throwing the same four pitches as he did last year (4-seam fastball, 2-seam fastball, changeup, slider), and his velocity doesn\u2019t appear to be any different. The biggest difference is that he\u2019s throwing his changeup much more often\u2014this is something he actually started doing during the second half of the 2018 season\u2014even with two-strike counts, and the changeup has been lights-out effective. In fact, no pitcher in baseball has recorded more strikeouts with any single pitch than Castillo\u2019s changeup. He\u2019s whiffed 35 hitters with just that pitch so far this season; Gerrit Cole (fastball) and Charlie Morton (curveball) are tied for second on that list, with 25 strikeouts each.\nPairing that elite changeup with a fastball that sits in the mid- to high-90s gives you a pitcher who often looks unhittable. A pitcher who often looks exactly like an ace, if I may be so bold.\nSimilarly, Gray has been one of the better pitchers in the league in his first experience in Cincinnati. He couldn\u2019t make it out of the third inning in his first start, but he\u2019s given fans nothing to complain about since that inauspicious debut, surrendering only seven runs in four starts. Even more impressive, Gray has struck out 31 hitters while walking only two during that span.\nI just spent plenty of words talking about why I think Castillo is an ace. Well, consider this: Gray\u2019s FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching, a statistic that essentially estimates what a pitcher\u2019s ERA would look like if he had a league-average defense behind him, measuring the things that pitchers can actually control) is 1.97 through his first five starts. That\u2019s the second-best mark in all of baseball and the best in the National League, just ahead of All-World hurler Max Scherzer.\nCould this be the same Sonny Gray that flamed out in New York over a year and a half with the Yankees? Well, yes, though his total numbers were actually pretty close to league average during that span (that hideous 6.98 ERA in games at Yankee Stadium contributed mightily to the narrative regarding Gray). Still, he was certainly a far cry from the pitcher who was an All-Star and an ace (or at least ace-adjacent) after bursting on the scene with the Oakland Athletics.\nSo why should we believe that Gray, at age 29, is returning to form before our eyes? Perhaps there\u2019s something to the narrative about the glare of Gotham that he isn\u2019t dealing with in the Queen City, where the media tends to be comparatively soft on the city\u2019s athletes. There are two more compelling reasons, in my view.\nFirst, Gray was critical of the Yankees organization for insisting that he throw his slider more often. In the off-season, he went back to his alma mater (Vanderbilt), where his old college pitching coach and one of his former teammates took him back to the drawing board. The analysis: Gray was right, and he needs to be throwing his curve more often and the slider less (among other tweaks).\nThe other reason I think Gray is a great candidate for a bounceback season is the identity of the old college pitching coach and teammate I mentioned above. Derek Johnson, Cincinnati\u2019s new pitching coach, was with Gray at Vanderbilt. The old college teammate who worked with Gray this winter was Caleb Cotham, who is now the Reds\u2019 assistant pitching coach. Circumstances seem to be lining up that will, at the very least, give Gray every opportunity to recapture his old form. Early returns are encouraging.\nIs Castillo going to finish this season as one of the top two or three starters in baseball, as he has been so far this season? That may be too much to ask, but there can be no question that he\u2019s talented enough to be a legitimate ace pitcher for years to come. And Gray is right behind him in terms of results so far this year, even if we shouldn\u2019t necessarily assume that he\u2019ll be as good as Castillo going forward.\nIt\u2019s beginning to look like an incredible one-two punch at the top of the Reds starting rotation, but I haven\u2019t yet mentioned the reason I\u2019m most excited about Castillo and Gray: They\u2019re both going to be Reds for a long time. Gray signed an extension before the trade from New York that will keep him in Cincinnati for three years after this one. Castillo won\u2019t be eligible for free agency for another year past that (if the Reds don\u2019t lock him up long-term before then).\nWe\u2019re very early in the season, and plenty could still go wrong that would alter this analysis. Perhaps I\u2019m dreaming a bit, but I don\u2019t think so. The Reds really could have one of the better one-two punches in the entire game. And that could be the key to the Reds being increasingly competitive over the next three years\u2026and perhaps beyond.\n", "prompt": "Luis Castillo and Sonny Gray are forming a formidable one-two punch at the top of the pitching rotation.\nIf you\u2019ve paid even mild attention to the Reds in recent years, you know that Cincinnati\u2019s pitching staff has been abysmal.

That may be too much to ask, but there can be no question that he\u2019s talented enough to be a legitimate ace pitcher for years to come. And Gray is right behind him in terms of results so far this year, even if we shouldn\u2019t necessarily assume that he\u2019ll be as good as Castillo going forward.\nIt\u2019s beginning to look like an incredible one-two punch at the top of the Reds starting rotation, but I haven\u2019t yet mentioned the reason I\u2019m most excited about Castillo and Gray: They\u2019re both going to be Reds for a long time. Gray signed an extension before the trade from New York that will keep him in Cincinnati for three years after this one. Castillo won\u2019t be eligible for free agency for another year past that (if the Reds don\u2019t lock him up long-term before then).\nWe\u2019re very early in the season, and plenty could still go wrong that would alter this analysis. Perhaps I\u2019m dreaming a bit, but I don\u2019t think so. The Reds really could have one of the better one-two punches in the entire game. And that could be the key to the Reds being increasingly competitive over the next three years\u2026and perhaps beyond.\n\nWrite a 500-word creative story:", "original_prompt": "Write a 500-word creative story:", "full_output": "Luis Castillo and Sonny Gray are forming a formidable one-two punch at the top of the pitching rotation.\nIf you\u2019ve paid even mild attention to the Reds in recent years, you know that Cincinnati\u2019s pitching staff has been abysmal. Seriously, go play around with the FanGraphs leaderboards for pitching over the last four seasons combined. (Or, better yet, don\u2019t do that and maintain some semblance of sanity.) No matter how you sort those numbers, from 2015 to 2018 the Reds haven\u2019t just had the worst pitching staff in all of baseball\u2014no other team has been particularly close.\nAfter yet another last place finish behind a terrible pitching staff, Reds owner Bob Castellini famously declared during the off-season that the team was going to \u201cget the pitching.\u201d And get the pitching they did, as management acquired three new starters who gave fans at least some measure of hope for 2019.\nThrough 21 games, those pitchers have been one of the better staffs in baseball. But two of them\u2014one holdover from the last couple of years and one newcomer\u2014have been so good that it\u2019s allowing me to dream a little about a one-two punch at the top of the Reds starting rotation that could be among the best in baseball for the foreseeable future. I\u2019m talking, of course, about Luis Castillo and Sonny Gray, both of whom been outstanding so far this season.\nCastillo takes the mound in San Diego tonight sporting a 1.46 ERA, 2.33 FIP and a 33.3% strikeout rate, and the metrics fueling those numbers suggest staying power. He\u2019s all over the Statcast starting pitching leaderboards: Second in whiff-per-swing rate, third in ground-ball rate, 13th in hard-hit rate, and he\u2019s yet to permit a single barrel (the most potent batted ball based on exit velocity and launch angle), let alone a home run.\nPut all those factors together, and Castillo has looked like one of MLB\u2019s best starters out of the gate. In fact, Statcast\u2019s expected weighted on-base average (xwOBA, based on quality of contact and strikeouts) places Castillo second behind reigning American League Cy Young winner Blake Snell.\nCastillo did give up his first homer of the season in that start in San Diego, but nothing else changed; he was still brilliant, allowing just one run on four hits and a walk, striking out nine over six strong innings. And if you glossed over all the nerd numbers above, permit me to simplify things for you: By almost any metric, Castillo has been perhaps the best starting pitcher in the National League.\nHow has he gotten out to such a strong start? Castillo is still throwing the same four pitches as he did last year (4-seam fastball, 2-seam fastball, changeup, slider), and his velocity doesn\u2019t appear to be any different. The biggest difference is that he\u2019s throwing his changeup much more often\u2014this is something he actually started doing during the second half of the 2018 season\u2014even with two-strike counts, and the changeup has been lights-out effective. In fact, no pitcher in baseball has recorded more strikeouts with any single pitch than Castillo\u2019s changeup. He\u2019s whiffed 35 hitters with just that pitch so far this season; Gerrit Cole (fastball) and Charlie Morton (curveball) are tied for second on that list, with 25 strikeouts each.\nPairing that elite changeup with a fastball that sits in the mid- to high-90s gives you a pitcher who often looks unhittable. A pitcher who often looks exactly like an ace, if I may be so bold.\nSimilarly, Gray has been one of the better pitchers in the league in his first experience in Cincinnati. He couldn\u2019t make it out of the third inning in his first start, but he\u2019s given fans nothing to complain about since that inauspicious debut, surrendering only seven runs in four starts. Even more impressive, Gray has struck out 31 hitters while walking only two during that span.\nI just spent plenty of words talking about why I think Castillo is an ace. Well, consider this: Gray\u2019s FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching, a statistic that essentially estimates what a pitcher\u2019s ERA would look like if he had a league-average defense behind him, measuring the things that pitchers can actually control) is 1.97 through his first five starts. That\u2019s the second-best mark in all of baseball and the best in the National League, just ahead of All-World hurler Max Scherzer.\nCould this be the same Sonny Gray that flamed out in New York over a year and a half with the Yankees? Well, yes, though his total numbers were actually pretty close to league average during that span (that hideous 6.98 ERA in games at Yankee Stadium contributed mightily to the narrative regarding Gray). Still, he was certainly a far cry from the pitcher who was an All-Star and an ace (or at least ace-adjacent) after bursting on the scene with the Oakland Athletics.\nSo why should we believe that Gray, at age 29, is returning to form before our eyes? Perhaps there\u2019s something to the narrative about the glare of Gotham that he isn\u2019t dealing with in the Queen City, where the media tends to be comparatively soft on the city\u2019s athletes. There are two more compelling reasons, in my view.\nFirst, Gray was critical of the Yankees organization for insisting that he throw his slider more often. In the off-season, he went back to his alma mater (Vanderbilt), where his old college pitching coach and one of his former teammates took him back to the drawing board. The analysis: Gray was right, and he needs to be throwing his curve more often and the slider less (among other tweaks).\nThe other reason I think Gray is a great candidate for a bounceback season is the identity of the old college pitching coach and teammate I mentioned above. Derek Johnson, Cincinnati\u2019s new pitching coach, was with Gray at Vanderbilt. The old college teammate who worked with Gray this winter was Caleb Cotham, who is now the Reds\u2019 assistant pitching coach. Circumstances seem to be lining up that will, at the very least, give Gray every opportunity to recapture his old form. Early returns are encouraging.\nIs Castillo going to finish this season as one of the top two or three starters in baseball, as he has been so far this season? That may be too much to ask, but there can be no question that he\u2019s talented enough to be a legitimate ace pitcher for years to come. And Gray is right behind him in terms of results so far this year, even if we shouldn\u2019t necessarily assume that he\u2019ll be as good as Castillo going forward.\nIt\u2019s beginning to look like an incredible one-two punch at the top of the Reds starting rotation, but I haven\u2019t yet mentioned the reason I\u2019m most excited about Castillo and Gray: They\u2019re both going to be Reds for a long time.

Let us have an overview of the most common questions asked in job interview with their appropriate answers.\nQuestion # 1: Describe Yourself?\nAnswer: This is the most concentrated questions for which candidates give a very reserved answer; in this question the employer expects to know everything regarding you and your personality. The best answer to this should include your name, family background, qualification, and experience, Knowledge, Skills and Abilities. This is because the employer generally wants an overview of the entire information which is being posted in the resume.\nQuestion # 2: What are your Strengths and Weaknesses?\nAnswer: When the employer asks for your strengths he is not interested in getting the information regarding in which games you are strong and competent but he is expecting to know those of your strengths which will be useful for that respective job vacancy for which the interview is being conducted. So make sure you identify and highlight those strengths and positive points in you which will enable you to do that respective job more appropriately.

This is because if you will make the employer identify your desperation and frustration to get the job he will perceive that you are jobless and de-motivated now and you need this job very badly, but instead of this you should tackle him like by saying that you are committed to test your knowledge in a more competent environment which is being seen in your company.\nQuestion # 4: What is your expected Salary?\nAnswer: This question can make or break your job interview that is why it is being made part of every job interview. While answering to this question make one thing sure that never post an amount which is below the average salary in the market for that job for which you are giving the interview because this will portrait that you are very much desperate for the job, secondly never post the amount which is higher than the market rate because that will not be accepted by the employer.

The goal of Habitat for Humanity is to help those in need by building homes for them, while teaching them the skills they need to build homes on their own.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this. I\u2019ve always lived in an apartment, never had my own house. For a lot of people, having your own house is not a big deal, they\u2019ve lived in a house for most of their lives, but for me, having your own house has been a dream come true. It\u2019s been like winning the lottery for me. I never thought that I would be able to have my own house, but when I found out that I would be getting one for free, I was very excited! My name was put into a raffle and if my name was drawn, then I would win the house. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to win or not, but when I got the call saying that I was the winner, I was so happy!

Swedish giants Malmo faced drogheda united in the Swedbank stadium following a scoreless draw in the 1st leg last week.\nOn a glorious Swedish evening, malmo dominated possession creating chance after chance, piling the pressure on the Drogheda defence but the Boynesiders resisted. Captain David Cassidy led his troops with bursts through the midfield occasionally but were often put to an end as Declan 'Fabio' O'Brien was isolated upfront acting as a lone striker.\nThe tale of the first half was that malmo couldn't break down a resolute drogs defence despite all the possession. The part timers also nearly took the lead when Cassidy won the ball in midfield and beat two players before lifting it over the top for O'Brien to run on to but the Malmo keeper Dahlin came out and managed to get his body inbetween O'Brien and the goal but there wasnt enough pace on the ball to carry it over the line and the malmo defenders got back to clear the ball.\nMoments away from the half-time whistle the swedes broke the deadlock .

The striker was one on one with Sava and somehow missed from eight yards as he dragged the ball wide. Mick Cooke's men continued to believe they could snatch that all important away goal but it wasn't going their way.

In between the free kicks, Chris Forrester hesitated when the ball came to his feet in the box and Zalgiris cleared the danger. Conan Byrne continued to cause trouble down the right wing, breaking into space again on 25 minutes, but his cross went just beyond Forrester at the back post. Sloppy play from Brennan in midfield led to a great chance for the away side to break the deadlock. Swift link-up play left Pavel Komolov in space, but Forrester did well to get back and block the attempt on goal. Shortly after Komolov again found himself on the ball as half time loomed and the momentum of the game began to turn.\nThe Lithuanian's struck a telling blow in first half injury time. Komolov picked up the ball in the Saint's box and cut the ball back for Kuklys and he took one touch to open the angle and drilled the ball low past a helpless Brendan Clarke to put the away side ahead in the game and in the tie. The Saints came out for the second half with a positive outlook as they pushed for an equaliser but unfortunately for the Inchicore outfit, Zalgiris added a second on 51 minutes.

We urge both Amazon and the bidding cities to adopt the same enterprising and transformative mindset regarding HQ2\u2019s role in shaping the future of energy.\nAmazon has impressive green credentials. The e-commerce giant is a top corporate purchaser of clean energy and is on its way to being 100 percent renewable. Buildings at its Seattle campus incorporate LED lighting and waste-heat recovery, operating at the forefront of energy efficiency.\nNow, by choosing which city will host its coveted HQ2, Amazon is paying close attention to sustainability criteria such as utility incentives for clean energy development and mass transit options for employees.\nWe encourage Amazon to reward proposals that extend clean energy benefits beyond the borders of HQ2, to enhance sustainability throughout the host city and state. Equally important, we call on the 20 finalist cities to make public all sustainability provisions of their HQ2 proposals.\nWe understand that cities are keeping certain incentives confidential in order to maintain a competitive edge. However, clean energy commitments should not be treated as private trade secrets, but rather as public best practices to promote and share.\nThe 19 U.S. cities and regions vying to attract HQ2 demonstrate widely varying degrees of commitment to sustainability in their proposals. For example, Boston touts its top rank in energy efficiency and its Climate Action Plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. For its proposed site at Suffolk Downs, Boston presents a vision that features subway access, rooftop solar panels, geothermal energy and data center waste-heat recovery.\nPhiladelphia trumpets its abundant mass transit and bike lanes. Its proposed uCity Square site could integrate a combined heat and power plant, and the Navy Yard site already features a nationally recognized electricity micro-grid with on-site solar generation and battery storage. Beyond promoting the Colorado Energy Plan, Denver details its utility\u2019s investment in energy innovation and ability to provide 100 percent renewable energy services.\nOther cities\u2019 proposals offer little in the way of clean energy provisions, or have not divulged such elements publicly. For example, Raleigh does not seem to discuss clean energy in its public proposal. New York City highlights its extensive subway system but does not outline specific clean energy plans.\nAustin has kept most of its proposal a secret, providing only vague references to sustainability in its public materials. Columbus proposes self-driving electric vehicles for sustainable transportation, but the environmental benefits of this strategy would likely be insignificant because Ohio relies on coal to produce more than half of its electricity.\nOn Amazon\u2019s end, HQ2 can serve as a catalyst to accelerate citywide and statewide clean energy initiatives, extending well beyond the new campus\u2019s perimeter. Even though HQ2 may add up to 8 million square feet of office space, its energy consumption will be small relative to a large metropolitan area. It would only require a fraction of the power output of a typical coal or natural gas power plant.\nOne venue where Amazon could maximize its sustainability impact is through securing access to renewable energy. Aside from covering HQ2 rooftops with solar panels, Amazon\u2019s ability to procure renewable power varies with the local electricity market structure. The company has an important choice to make.\nAmazon can conveniently locate HQ2 in one of 13 American cities where deregulated power markets allow customers to choose their renewable energy suppliers.

Even though he was her age, she had felt like she was just a child as he was speaking with her, making the decision to end things with him was easier. She had not felt like she knew him at all. How could he have been so different this time around.\nShe made a vow to herself to make sure that she never allowed herself to get so involved with a man in the future.

Things happen when buying and selling Real Estate that even defy reason, and all we can do sometimes is learn what not to do next time.\nBut, certain things can be done to prevent mistakes from happening. In an effort to avoid making big mistakes in purchasing a home, there are two key pieces of advice that I can offer \u2013 communication and planning. Communication is critical to better understanding, and that communication should involve everyone (including your spouse, and your agent, etc.). Planning ahead by having a goal (homeownership) and saving money, gathering resources, asking questions, and keeping track of your progress by writing it all down helps you keep in focus \u2013 and ultimately brings you success!\nOne of the more interesting experiences I have recently had that strays from this advice was helping a young married couple that recently moved here after the husband finished his career with the military.\nThey were staying with family at the time, and had a baby daughter with another child on the way in the next few months. These folks were motivated to get settled in their own home. They didn\u2019t want to continue staying where they were.\nI met them at an open house that I was hosting, and after visiting the home for about five minutes, the husband informed me that they were ready to write an offer. I thought this was a little peculiar, but instead of immediately putting pen to paper, I took the time to learn more about their needs and background first. After talking with them and figuring out their interests a little more, I began to realize that these folks had no understanding about the process of buying a home. All they knew is that they could use the husband\u2019s VA benefit, but they didn\u2019t take the time to get pre-approved.\nAdditionally, they didn\u2019t know what was available on the market. The husband\u2019s rationale was that he knew how much house payment they could afford, so he found a mortgage calculator online and did some quick math to determine their overall price range \u2013 and then off to find some open houses in Olympia (Washington).\nThe husband seemed insistent that this was the right house for them and wanted to move forward before someone else buys the home, but I managed to convince them that we should go look at other homes on the market first before they make their final decision.\nWe saw three other homes in the area that were similar in value to the home I held open, and the husband informed me that they had changed their mind and wanted to buy the third home they toured instead. I advised them that it is in their best interests to be pre-approved first, otherwise the seller is not going to take their offer seriously.\nBefore they left, I gave them three references for local lenders in the area to contact immediately to get pre-approved. The next day, the husband called me and let me know that they changed their minds and were reverting back to making an offer on the home I was holding open, and they were going to contact my recommended lenders that day.\nI followed up with them the next day to find out how they are doing, and the husband told me that he and his wife \u2018finally communicated\u2019 and decided that they\u2019re not yet ready to buy.\nAs a professional, my immediate instinct when I meet people that don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re doing is to help and educate them about the process, and guide them towards making good choices. Sometimes for me, that equates to investing time and energy that results in nothing gained. But, what would have been more tragic in this scenario is seeing this young couple being taken advantage of and being placed in a precarious situation they don\u2019t know how to get out of.\nHaving the desire to own a home is a good start, but you have to have a goal and a plan to get there. It was clear to me in the beginning that communication and planning were not yet part of the picture for this young couple, and hopefully this experience for them will be a lesson learned before they actually buy a home.\nIt was a lovely home, and suited their taste and needs to a tee. It was almost as if the home was tailor-made for them. They made an offer on the home, and it was accepted.\nThe home inspection did not turn up any major issues, and the sellers were very accommodating to making some requested repairs.\nEverything seemed to be well, and then the unexpected \u2013 the husband was being relocated in his job to another part of town. They could no longer justify buying the home, but they were legally committed to it. Their only option was to lose their earnest money and walk away from it. It was tragic to watch it happen, because they truly loved this home.\nBut as tragic as it was to witness, the bright side to the story was that the buyers were prepared to shift their focus and move on to find another home. The loss of their earnest money was unfortunate, but did not create a financial hardship for them.\nThey were able to find another home that was ideal for their needs, a better overall value, and in close range to the husband\u2019s place of business. The short-term stumble did not stop them from accomplishing their ultimate goal.\nIn part 2 of this article, Ed shares a BIG mistake made by one of his buyers.

Things happen when buying and selling Real Estate that even defy reason, and all we can do sometimes is learn what not to do next time.\nBut, certain things can be done to prevent mistakes from happening. In an effort to avoid making big mistakes in purchasing a home, there are two key pieces of advice that I can offer \u2013 communication and planning. Communication is critical to better understanding, and that communication should involve everyone (including your spouse, and your agent, etc.). Planning ahead by having a goal (homeownership) and saving money, gathering resources, asking questions, and keeping track of your progress by writing it all down helps you keep in focus \u2013 and ultimately brings you success!\nOne of the more interesting experiences I have recently had that strays from this advice was helping a young married couple that recently moved here after the husband finished his career with the military.\nThey were staying with family at the time, and had a baby daughter with another child on the way in the next few months. These folks were motivated to get settled in their own home. They didn\u2019t want to continue staying where they were.\nI met them at an open house that I was hosting, and after visiting the home for about five minutes, the husband informed me that they were ready to write an offer. I thought this was a little peculiar, but instead of immediately putting pen to paper, I took the time to learn more about their needs and background first. After talking with them and figuring out their interests a little more, I began to realize that these folks had no understanding about the process of buying a home. All they knew is that they could use the husband\u2019s VA benefit, but they didn\u2019t take the time to get pre-approved.\nAdditionally, they didn\u2019t know what was available on the market. The husband\u2019s rationale was that he knew how much house payment they could afford, so he found a mortgage calculator online and did some quick math to determine their overall price range \u2013 and then off to find some open houses in Olympia (Washington).\nThe husband seemed insistent that this was the right house for them and wanted to move forward before someone else buys the home, but I managed to convince them that we should go look at other homes on the market first before they make their final decision.\nWe saw three other homes in the area that were similar in value to the home I held open, and the husband informed me that they had changed their mind and wanted to buy the third home they toured instead.

The node stores the harvested energy in an energy buffer and uses the stored energy to transmit data to the AP in the uplink (UL). We consider a simple transmission policy, which accounts for the fact that in practice the EH node may not have knowledge of the EH profile nor of the UL channel state information. In particular, in each time slot, the EH node transmits with either a constant desired power or a lower power if not enough energy is available in its energy buffer. For this simple policy, we use the theory of discrete-time continuous-state Markov chains to analyze the limiting distribution of the stored energy for finite- and infinite-size energy buffers. Moreover, we take into account imperfections of the energy buffer and the circuit power consumption of the EH node. For a Rayleigh fading DL channel, we provide the limiting distribution of the energy buffer content in closed form. In addition, we analyze the average error rate and the outage probability of a Rayleigh faded UL channel and show that the diversity order is not affected by the finite capacity of the energy buffer. Our results reveal that the optimal desired transmit power by the EH node is always less than the average harvested power and increases with the capacity of the energy buffer.\n\nWrite a 500-word creative story: the story should include: 1) the problem and the motivation of the problem, 2) a short background of the main concept(s) and the model and assumption, 3) a step-by-step explanation of the main idea(s) and the solution approach, 4) the final result and implication, and\n5) a discussion of the possible extension and future direction of this work.\nDo not use any pictures.\nTo meet the deadline, we ask you to submit the final draft of your paper through Turnitin.\nWe strongly encourage you to submit your paper to Turnitin.\nYour submitted paper will be graded based on the following criteria:", "completion_only": "the story should include: 1) the problem and the motivation of the problem, 2) a short background of the main concept(s) and the model and assumption, 3) a step-by-step explanation of the main idea(s) and the solution approach, 4) the final result and implication, and\n5) a discussion of the possible extension and future direction of this work.\nDo not use any pictures.\nTo meet the deadline, we ask you to submit the final draft of your paper through Turnitin.\nWe strongly encourage you to submit your paper to Turnitin.\nYour submitted paper will be graded based on the following criteria:", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 46, "avg_token_entropy": 1.5946120817697693, "avg_token_perplexity": 7.317766406993796, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

Did you celebrate the twins\u2019 birthday last week with Robin and Jake? These are the times when I really wish Edna and I had children\u2014I can only imagine how much fun it must be to chase around those grandkids of yours!\nI\u2019m writing to tell you about a funny thing that happened to me last week when I was having more trouble with my pesky ticker and kidneys. Everything\u2019s fine now, but I ended up having to spend a night at Dalton General.\nNow, if Edna were still alive, she would\u2019ve probably had another heart attack if she found out I spent the night at the hospital, so before you get all worked up, let me just say the hospitalization wasn\u2019t as bad as they\u2019ve been in the past. This time, believe it or not, I actually had a little fun at the hospital after the docs fixed me up.\nI know you\u2019re thinking fun at a hospital is an oxymoron, so let me explain. While I was recovering the morning after my kidneys gave out (more about that later) a camera crew knocked on my door and asked if I\u2019d like to appear in a short film they were making. The producer said they were trying to capture some video that would show how unique Metro\u2019s Acute Care for Elders unit is\u2014they call it ACE for short.\nYou know me, I was happy to ham it up in front of the camera. I had a little trouble mustering up my old, booming, broadcasting voice, but the taping went well. I think the crew was pretty impressed when I told them how my voice used to be mistaken for James Earl Jones\u2019. Here\u2019s a link they sent of me going on about my former career.\nIt sure was a hoot to be in front of the camera again. The head of the ACE unit interviewed me about what I expect from the nurses there, and they filmed me being discharged from the hospital too. Working with the fellas in the film crew really helped me to forget the awful night I had the day before, the nerve-racking incident that got me stuck in the hospital in the first place.\nIt started last Monday afternoon, when I began getting this awful metallic taste in my mouth that wouldn\u2019t go away. When I was fixing dinner in the kitchen, I felt dizzy and sick to my stomach, and I had to take a seat to catch my breath. I thought the take-out I got for lunch wasn\u2019t agreeing with me, but then I noticed that my feet had swelled up far more than they normally do. After I looked up all the symptoms on-line, I decided to call the ambulance because I realized that either my kidneys could be giving out or I was having congestive heart failure! It turns out that the symptoms for the two conditions are very similar. When the doctors finally had a look at me, they determined my kidneys were the culprits, and the ticker was OK; so that provided a tiny bit of relief.\nThey hooked me up to a dialysis machine at the hospital and sedated me. When I came to, the doc told me that I\u2019d have two more prescriptions from now on\u2014that\u2019s five pills every day now! He said that if I don\u2019t stick to my diet and keep doing my exercises, I\u2019ll probably end up hauling around a portable dialysis machine\u2026that sure would put a damper on getting around. I mean, how could I have the guts to ask Margaret Jenkins out on another date if I\u2019m toting around a big clumsy machine on wheels? Here\u2019s a link to a video of a fella hauling one around. You\u2019ll have to watch an ad before the thing starts \u2013 that\u2019s how they getcha!\nI\u2019ve got to run to a book club meeting, but I\u2019ll be sure to write again soon.

Margaret stopped by after our book club meeting yesterday and she thought it was just the cutest thing. I\u2019m recovering surprisingly quickly and my feet aren\u2019t nearly as swollen as they were. I guess all these new drugs are working after all. I feel pretty refreshed.\nI just heard from the video producers who are putting together the film about the Acute Care for Elders unit at Dalton General. It turns out they\u2019re making the video to show to our state legislators. They want to encourage them to approve the funding to build more ACE units in other hospitals throughout Ohio.\nI\u2019ll probably write a letter to Congresswoman Sutton this evening about it too\u2014I guess it couldn\u2019t hurt.  They had carpet instead of cold tiles on the floor and nice, big windows too. There was even a common living area for the patients to use where you could sit and read, put together a puzzle, or just socialize. I only wish they had an internet hook-up!\nDespite all the niceties, though, I think their staff may be a tad over-worked. You\u2019ll see in one of the video clips I attached how I complained to the head of the unit, Lyn Benedict, about how I couldn\u2019t get the nurses\u2019 attention when I buzzed them. I needed to use the restroom, but I couldn\u2019t because no one came to unhook me from my dialysis machine after I rang my bell. I had to hold it for twenty minutes\u2014with a pair of bad kidneys, mind you!\nIn the second clip, you\u2019ll notice that the nurse conducting the discharge goofs on one of my medications! She said I should take Metoprolol, even though I\u2019m on Coreg for my blood pressure; good thing I caught that. It seems like whenever my file gets moved from one hospital to the next, my meds always seem to get all mixed up. I really have to stay on top of it to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.\nDo you think the video editors will use any of my parts in their film for the state?

After my little kidney episode earlier this month, Dr. Rodgers thought it would be best for me to have a nurse visit twice a month. She came for the first time yesterday and she seems nice enough. Her name\u2019s Casandra and she wanted to make sure I was still avoiding sugar and salt and keeping up with all my meds\u2026even she was surprised with how many I\u2019m taking\u2014Coumadin, Flomax, Coreg, my beta blocker, a potassium pill three times a day, and Augmentin.

I\u2019ve includes a couple links if you\u2019re interested; one\u2019s an article I found the Chicago Tribune about this senior craze, and the other is a video of a nursing home Wii tournament! I could see you and the grandkids having a ball with this. Now if only I could get my insurance company to buy me a Nintendo!\nThe insurance company does cover Casandra\u2019s visits though, which is lucky, because my newest pills aren\u2019t 100% covered. I figured out last night that, even with insurance, I\u2019ll still have to pay about $2,000 a year out-of-pocket for all these meds. This is why I\u2019m including a link about House Bill 676, The US National Health Insurance Act, that I told you about a while back \u2013 it\u2019s the one that Senator Brown supports. If it ever got approved, I think it could really help to keep prescription drug prices down. All of my older friends in the book club are getting stuck with these ever rising prescription costs. It seems like ever since that Prescription Improvement and Modernization Act was signed back in \u201803, the drugs started to become pricier\u2014I thought the whole purpose of the thing was to make them cheaper for seniors! I\u2019ve pasted a link to an article from Duke that lambastes the Act, if you\u2019re interested. My neighbor Marty claims he goes online and gets the cheap knock-offs from Canada and Mexico\u2014but I\u2019m too chicken to dabble in the black market.\nAll in all, though, despite all the hassle, I\u2019ve still got my health, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. This whole kidney scare has got me appreciating every little ounce of life that much more. I feel petty lucky to still be as active as I am, and the thought of hauling around that dialysis machine is really motivating me to me to keep at it. I\u2019ll take a video game machine over one of those things any day of the week!

What do they have you on these days to help with the hip replacement?\nShe said that lots of older people are using this new Nintendo Wii to keep fit. Apparently, you can play tennis and golf, even bowl. I was a little wary but I did a little research, and sure enough, senior citizens really are going bananas for this thing. I\u2019ve includes a couple links if you\u2019re interested; one\u2019s an article I found the Chicago Tribune about this senior craze, and the other is a video of a nursing home Wii tournament! I could see you and the grandkids having a ball with this. Now if only I could get my insurance company to buy me a Nintendo!\nThe insurance company does cover Casandra\u2019s visits though, which is lucky, because my newest pills aren\u2019t 100% covered. I figured out last night that, even with insurance, I\u2019ll still have to pay about $2,000 a year out-of-pocket for all these meds. This is why I\u2019m including a link about House Bill 676, The US National Health Insurance Act, that I told you about a while back \u2013 it\u2019s the one that Senator Brown supports. If it ever got approved, I think it could really help to keep prescription drug prices down. All of my older friends in the book club are getting stuck with these ever rising prescription costs. It seems like ever since that Prescription Improvement and Modernization Act was signed back in \u201803, the drugs started to become pricier\u2014I thought the whole purpose of the thing was to make them cheaper for seniors! I\u2019ve pasted a link to an article from Duke that lambastes the Act, if you\u2019re interested. My neighbor Marty claims he goes online and gets the cheap knock-offs from Canada and Mexico\u2014but I\u2019m too chicken to dabble in the black market.\nAll in all, though, despite all the hassle, I\u2019ve still got my health, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. This whole kidney scare has got me appreciating every little ounce of life that much more. I feel petty lucky to still be as active as I am, and the thought of hauling around that dialysis machine is really motivating me to me to keep at it. I\u2019ll take a video game machine over one of those things any day of the week! Speaking of, I think it\u2019s time for your 84 year-old older brother to drive himself out to the mall so he can buy himself a new toy. I\u2019ll tell you all about my new Wii after I give it a swing.\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Fiction, thriller/horror/suspense, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Drama, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Comedy, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Romance, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Mystery/Thriller, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Science Fiction/Fantasy, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Western, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Horror, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Adventure/Action, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Historical, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Poetry, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Children's, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Horror, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Fantasy, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Romance, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Science Fiction, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Western, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Mystery, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Historical, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Comedy, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Children's, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Drama, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Poetry, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Fantasy, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Western, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Nonfiction, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Mystery, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a", "completion_only": "- Fiction, thriller/horror/suspense, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Drama, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Comedy, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Romance, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Mystery/Thriller, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Science Fiction/Fantasy, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Western, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Horror, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Adventure/Action, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Historical, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Poetry, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Children's, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Horror, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Fantasy, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Romance, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Science Fiction, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Western, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Mystery, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Historical, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Comedy, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Children's, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Drama, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Poetry, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Fantasy, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Western, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Nonfiction, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a 500-word creative story: - Mystery, 500 words (3%)\nWrite a", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 49, "avg_token_entropy": 0.24069866685570424, "avg_token_perplexity": 1.9791062140053768, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

Now, I\u2019m sure a lot of you guys have wanted to be able to contribute more to the \u2018Charms community here but just don\u2019t know how to. Perhaps you\u2019re too scared to say anything lest you get a warning, or you\u2019re too shy and are afraid the people here will make fun of you. Worry no longer, for I, Shiny, am here to give you a step-by-step guide to change you from Newbie to Member!\nStep 1: Read the rules.\nThe one step you absolutely have to do. You can find the rules and other important things here. If you really don\u2019t want to read those boring rules, I\u2019ll paraphrase them for you.\nDon\u2019t use chatspeak, overuse smileys, or use all caps in one post.\nQuality over quantity (meaning don\u2019t worry about your post count; that has nothing to do with your standing as a respectable member).\nFlaming is prohibited; be nice to us, and we\u2019ll be nice to you.\nNo double posting, unless you\u2019re the creator of a topic in the Creativity Pit.\nRead every other board\u2019s rules if you\u2019re going to post in them (ie. Read the General Fiction rules if you want to post a fic or comment or one). They can be found at the top of the page of each board.\nThere, was that so hard now? Read them? Memorized them? Good, now onto Step 2.\nStep 2: Lurk around for a bit.\nSome people might disagree on me in this, but I find people who lurk a bit before posting to be better members in the long run than those who post before looking around a bit. Why? Because if you refrain from posting and just check out what we\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll know how we run things and understand what to do or not to do. You see how we post, comment, role play, etc, and so now you\u2019ll know how to do it correctly. It also allows you to know where to post certain topics, which is pretty helpful.\nStep 3: Introduce yourself.\nDo NOT PM a person and say, \u201chey I\u2019m new want to be my friend?\u201d, because you\u2019ll probably be ignored, and your reputation just went down by over 9000 points. There are other and better ways to introduce yourself. For example, if you\u2019re a spriter, post a sprite thread in the Sprites and Sprite Comics forum. If you write, go ahead and post your work(s) in the General Fiction board. The easiest way to introduce yourself is to just go to the New Member Introduction Thread here and say hello. You could also go onto chat and talk to the regulars there, which ties in nicely with my next step.\nStep 4: Drop by in Chat.\nPeople will start knowing you when you begin posting regularly, and great places to begin are in the Small Talk, Pokemon Chat, or War Room boards. They\u2019re filled with little topics that are great for expressing your opinion or just for, well, talking. The Playground is also a great place to post as well, if you\u2019re interested in forum games and stuff. Commenting in these kinds of topics will probably help ease your anxiety about posting here, since no one really judges you for what you put there. Remember, quality over quantity, so don\u2019t post a bunch of single-sentence posts. Elaborate on your opinions, give details, so on and so forth. It also helps to read the first post of every topic, so you know what people are talking about.\nStep 6: Make a name for yourself!\nMost of the people here are well known for a certain aspect of themselves. Tunduli\u2019s an amazing spriter, Carmen writes terrific stories, LoN\u2019s signature making skills is the bomb, Virgil\u2019s art is uber cute and really good, etc. You don\u2019t have to start out big; maybe just post in a few threads or join an RP. If you have works you want to show us, go ahead and make a thread in the Pit of Creativity and show it to us! Remember, it takes time for people to recognize your skills, so don\u2019t get discouraged if no one comments on your stuff. They\u2019ll start coming once you establish yourself in the community, so that means\u2026 don\u2019t give up! Keep trying!\nMost people here do give criticism to works, but we\u2019re not trying to beat you up with words. In fact, these words are meant to help you get better. So accept these pieces of advice with joy; that means you\u2019re noticed and we think you have potential.\n If you really want to become known, though, and have your name written down into \u2018Charms history, following most of these will get you to that position.\nHow to Reach Pokecharms Chat!\nThe Nuzlocke Challenge! Pokemon Hardmode!\nNo double posting, unless you\u2019re the creator of a topic in the Creativity Pit. - AND YOU'RE POSTING NEW MATERIAL IN YOUR OWN TOPIC!\nJust because some people are idiots, and might think that because they're the creator of a topic in the Creativity Pit, that they get to double-post everywhere else!\n\nNo body's perfect, not even me, the admins, or moderators. That doesn't mean that we can't improve, so whenever people criticize your works, don't take it personally. We're not trying to be mean; on the contrary, we're trying to help you improve. Good writers know to lap up good critiques like it's water in the desert, and thus take them to heart and actually try to improve from there. Even if you took a long time making something and yet you still get critiqued, it's okay! That doesn't mean your work went to waste; think of it like a stepping stone to getting better. We all want to get to the top, right? Failures are part of the way to get there.\nThat being said, you're not going to be friends with everyone here, because, unfortunately, the world is a mess and you might not like some of the personalities here. Most of the regulars are rather nice, but some might accidentally rub you the wrong way or something. Keep it to yourself, and don't ruin the Pokecharms experience for others. If you really think you have to, send the person a PM telling you why you don't really like them and how you guys could solve your differences together. If that still doesn't work much, fine. Just smile and nod and go on with life; you're not going to like everything in life, but you have to learn to keep moving forward.\n", "prompt": "Discussion in 'Questions and Site Feedback' started by Shiny Pyxis, Sep 27, 2010.\nHello everyone, I\u2019m Flandre, previously known as Shiny Eevee, of the forums!

If you write, go ahead and post your work(s) in the General Fiction board. The easiest way to introduce yourself is to just go to the New Member Introduction Thread here and say hello. You could also go onto chat and talk to the regulars there, which ties in nicely with my next step.\nStep 4: Drop by in Chat.\nPeople will start knowing you when you begin posting regularly, and great places to begin are in the Small Talk, Pokemon Chat, or War Room boards. They\u2019re filled with little topics that are great for expressing your opinion or just for, well, talking. The Playground is also a great place to post as well, if you\u2019re interested in forum games and stuff. Commenting in these kinds of topics will probably help ease your anxiety about posting here, since no one really judges you for what you put there. Remember, quality over quantity, so don\u2019t post a bunch of single-sentence posts. Elaborate on your opinions, give details, so on and so forth. It also helps to read the first post of every topic, so you know what people are talking about.\nStep 6: Make a name for yourself!\nMost of the people here are well known for a certain aspect of themselves. Tunduli\u2019s an amazing spriter, Carmen writes terrific stories, LoN\u2019s signature making skills is the bomb, Virgil\u2019s art is uber cute and really good, etc. You don\u2019t have to start out big; maybe just post in a few threads or join an RP. If you have works you want to show us, go ahead and make a thread in the Pit of Creativity and show it to us! Remember, it takes time for people to recognize your skills, so don\u2019t get discouraged if no one comments on your stuff. They\u2019ll start coming once you establish yourself in the community, so that means\u2026 don\u2019t give up! Keep trying!\nMost people here do give criticism to works, but we\u2019re not trying to beat you up with words. In fact, these words are meant to help you get better. So accept these pieces of advice with joy; that means you\u2019re noticed and we think you have potential.\n If you really want to become known, though, and have your name written down into \u2018Charms history, following most of these will get you to that position.\nHow to Reach Pokecharms Chat!\nThe Nuzlocke Challenge! Pokemon Hardmode!\nNo double posting, unless you\u2019re the creator of a topic in the Creativity Pit. - AND YOU'RE POSTING NEW MATERIAL IN YOUR OWN TOPIC!\nJust because some people are idiots, and might think that because they're the creator of a topic in the Creativity Pit, that they get to double-post everywhere else!\n\nNo body's perfect, not even me, the admins, or moderators. That doesn't mean that we can't improve, so whenever people criticize your works, don't take it personally. We're not trying to be mean; on the contrary, we're trying to help you improve. Good writers know to lap up good critiques like it's water in the desert, and thus take them to heart and actually try to improve from there. Even if you took a long time making something and yet you still get critiqued, it's okay! That doesn't mean your work went to waste; think of it like a stepping stone to getting better. We all want to get to the top, right? Failures are part of the way to get there.\nThat being said, you're not going to be friends with everyone here, because, unfortunately, the world is a mess and you might not like some of the personalities here. Most of the regulars are rather nice, but some might accidentally rub you the wrong way or something. Keep it to yourself, and don't ruin the Pokecharms experience for others. If you really think you have to, send the person a PM telling you why you don't really like them and how you guys could solve your differences together. If that still doesn't work much, fine. Just smile and nod and go on with life; you're not going to like everything in life, but you have to learn to keep moving forward.\n\nWrite a 500-word creative story:", "original_prompt": "Write a 500-word creative story:", "full_output": "Discussion in 'Questions and Site Feedback' started by Shiny Pyxis, Sep 27, 2010.\nHello everyone, I\u2019m Flandre, previously known as Shiny Eevee, of the forums! Now, I\u2019m sure a lot of you guys have wanted to be able to contribute more to the \u2018Charms community here but just don\u2019t know how to. Perhaps you\u2019re too scared to say anything lest you get a warning, or you\u2019re too shy and are afraid the people here will make fun of you. Worry no longer, for I, Shiny, am here to give you a step-by-step guide to change you from Newbie to Member!\nStep 1: Read the rules.\nThe one step you absolutely have to do. You can find the rules and other important things here. If you really don\u2019t want to read those boring rules, I\u2019ll paraphrase them for you.\nDon\u2019t use chatspeak, overuse smileys, or use all caps in one post.\nQuality over quantity (meaning don\u2019t worry about your post count; that has nothing to do with your standing as a respectable member).\nFlaming is prohibited; be nice to us, and we\u2019ll be nice to you.\nNo double posting, unless you\u2019re the creator of a topic in the Creativity Pit.\nRead every other board\u2019s rules if you\u2019re going to post in them (ie. Read the General Fiction rules if you want to post a fic or comment or one). They can be found at the top of the page of each board.\nThere, was that so hard now? Read them? Memorized them? Good, now onto Step 2.\nStep 2: Lurk around for a bit.\nSome people might disagree on me in this, but I find people who lurk a bit before posting to be better members in the long run than those who post before looking around a bit. Why? Because if you refrain from posting and just check out what we\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll know how we run things and understand what to do or not to do. You see how we post, comment, role play, etc, and so now you\u2019ll know how to do it correctly. It also allows you to know where to post certain topics, which is pretty helpful.\nStep 3: Introduce yourself.\nDo NOT PM a person and say, \u201chey I\u2019m new want to be my friend?\u201d, because you\u2019ll probably be ignored, and your reputation just went down by over 9000 points.

But there are many deep rooted personal reasons for why people believe things they do, and only by open dialogue and willing to hear from other perspectives will enable us to make decisions relating to tough questions in life. For some, religion is too difficult to talk about or understand and that's fine, you don't need to post here. But those interested in learning more about how faith works from their point of view being an adherent of a certain faith, or maybe therelackof, can share and learn from others in a constructive environment. I hope this thread can start to do some of that. Anyone can feel free to post questions, comments or thoughts, regardless of whether they believe in God, or not, and whatever faith they have. Please be respectful of opinions and don't resort to personal attacks.\nI begin on Christianity, Jesus and the Bible continuing off from my previous discussion in abraxas' thread on Bill Maher and Islam. I have moved some posts from the original thread here. I reveal myself to be a practising Christian and not a terribly good one in fact, but God is thankfully forgiving.\n(Regarding the Jewish saying on justice \"an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth\") Well, maybe if you take it literally and take upon yourself to be judge, jury and executioner. In a way judicial system we take for \"just\" is that lunacy made official and it's even worse because of corruption.\nBut if you try to discern deeper meaning, it's close to concept of Karma, as a law of the Universe, or even as in elementary physics Newton's 3rd law of action-reaction. What goes around comes around.\nTit for tat is an ideal law because God is just by nature. But Jesus never removes it altogether but instead asks people to entrust justice to God who will bring it forth in his time.\nChristian justice demands all to be condemned under God's holy and righteous standards. But Jesus took it upon himself to bear that judgment for himself. That's the reason he can say to turn the other cheek and forgive people because he first absorbed the cost.\nWaving Wilson magic one point at a time | KEI all the way!!!\nPlease check our new site rules and regulations update re: infractions MTF Site Wide Rules and Regulations Update 19/02/2020 - Infraction System Overhaul. Please Read Carefully!\nIt's questionable if Jesus was historical figure at all, or if he was, how romanticized and adapted to suit someone's needs New Testament is. Same with Old Testament. Same with Quran.\nAnyway, reading any of these texts like they're just some novel is worse than not reading it at all imo.\nThere is actually more evidence to suggest he was real compared to many other famous people around the time based on sheer manuscript copies, corroboration of gospel writers and other non Christian writers.\nRead The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel who was a journalist hoping to prove Jesus wrong through historical facts and instead became convinced he was real and Lord. The other thing is Christians present a losing gospel. It is open to fail. You can falsify Christisnity in one fell swoop by proving that Jesus did not die and then rise from the dead. No other religion has this block of vulnerability. The disciples ran away scared when Jesus was captured and killed. Next minute they claim their Lord is alive. How do you sell that? They wouldn't last one bit if Jesus had died and remained dead as the disciples were all tortured and many executed on account of Jesus. You don't give your life for a known lie. If Jesus had survived the cross and he was frail then no one would follow him. Someone happened to make the disciples emboldened especially considering the Jewish leaders and the Roman authorities . I can discuss more on this.\nAlso I dare that say nobody in history could ever devise a fictional Jesus. He was so against the grain and counter cultural not even the disciples understood him. There's no one who would write him the way he's presented in the New Testament because this Jesus is very hard to get and even offensive! They would have to be so clever to write the greatest story ever told.\nThis is all very questionable.To me this sounds only feasible if I'd make a leap of faith, which I won't (I'm Agnostic), so any further discussion is moot.\nI'm 99% certain journalist story is just propaganda tho.\nTakes a greater leap of faith to consider Jesus as a total legend when Luke mentions a Roman census which Jesus' parents were required to register for and records. Additionally by 79 AD Nero reported Christians he blamed for fires. So there were such believers within 50 years of Jesus many who may have seen him or his dusciples. A legend doesn't emerge till at least 150-200 years after the subject has died.\nAlso think: why is it the year 2018 AD?\nAD = anno domini, in the year of our lord.\nPeople have created an alternative to CE but the number hasn't changed. History conveniently finds a way to mark Jesus as a turning point.\nHowever why I say it's unlikely someone made up Jesus is because he goes against every expectation of a religious revolutionary. Why make Jesus so maligned by the Jewish religious leaders? Why make him often criticize them? Why make Jesus associate 'eat and drink' with so called sinners? These are big no nos in Jewish culture. Heck even the average Jew had great respect for the Pharisees who they considered devout.\nThe worst of these big no nos is the fact that Jesus was publically executed. In the Old Testament it writes 'cursed is anyone who hangs from a tree'. Not only was it barbaric an execution, it was without honour as bodies would been thrown into refuse afterwards. Reserved for the worst criminals. Muslims themselves take issue with Jesus being allowed to be humiliated like this. They suggest God make it look as if Jesus was on the cross when it was somebody else, an illusion while Jesus escaped.\nThe fate his disciples later go through as they are often beaten, put into prison and face governors, before being martyred. To me if you wanted to start a world class religion you'd try to appeal to everybody on the same wavelength. For the Jews, they were getting fed up of Roman occupation. Why not present Jesus as that dude who would bring Jerusalem back to glory? Jesus resisted this urge and never fought the Roman Empire. Why not make the disciples look like titans? They were often mocked and looked like fools in front of Jesus.\nEven the Old Testament spends 80% of the time saying how crap Israel is rather than describe it as the greatest thing on earth. There's two books where literally every king of Israel is said to be worthless chapter after chapter (1/2 Kings). Israel is compared to as an unfaithful wife by the prophet Hosea. Moses and Joshua plainly tell the people they will rebel against God. One could mistake the Jews to be very irreligious reading such critical commentary of their history. The only reason one would write it like this is that it was real. If it was glossy and lofty, it was likely fabricated. But a death tortured and humiliated Jesus who the Jews rejected makes little sense as a religious hero. It's counterproductive and affords little gain for anybody to follow him unless they truly believed who he was and was resurrected.\nI don't consider Jesus fictional character. I'm sure there was a man/being this character is based on more or less. But to take new testament (and there are significant differences between Gospels) as factual history? No.\nSignificant differences? Do share. They corroborate more than not, different perspectives of the same events. And before you suggest it, the Luke vs Matthew genealogies aren't incompatible, they take different parental heritages into account. The Matthew one is striking because it picks on some of Jesus' ancestors (David adultery with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite mentioned blankly).\nYou might not trust the gospel accounts which is fine but you can't refute church history. It has survived all these years when it should have been buried. The Christian church did not start from any position of strength or power. Actually the best part of the gospel might be Acts, rather than the first four. Acts continues where Luke finished and describes how the church spread.\nAlso church doesn't start with Jesus, but much later, which involved much more politics than faith.\nIf we're talking about today's Christianity, what we're talking about? Vatican,Orthodox, Protestant, Methodist... KJ Bible isn't same bible like Orthodox Christians read, for example.\nOld Testament is fascinating read for me, no matter how I look at it, as a fiction, history or coded knowledge.\nNew Testament is hard for me to read. Much more boring and I find Jesus character quite unconvincing, whether I look at him as con-artist, crazy guy or a son of God. Actually, Jesus is most believable as some kind of a revolutionary who made a lot of unwanted noise, so they damage control/twisted him into a religion.\nNew Testament is fascinating read for me, no matter how I look at it, as a fiction, history or coded knowledge.\nNew Testament is hard for me to read.

Christianity certainly does that, but he might have claimed only that he's Messiah or just a son of God, which is not same as the son of God.\nThey are as factual as any other documents of the time. Luke was a very astute historian, a physician by occupation and one to record details in great length. The number of early manuscripts for the New Testament dwarfs any other documents of antiquity of similar times that are often, taken as factual. Our sense of history, especially ancient times, is only found in historical documents.\nAnother note, the new testament is really only made up of historical books (the gospels, and Acts) and letters and one book of prophecy - Revelation. Most of the records can be verified with other documents and archaeological finds. The element of faith is of course necessary as the Book clearly states numerous times; this is never hidden. The message of the New Testament is that there is something wrong with the human heart (condition) which seems hard to argue, and Jesus is interesting in changing hearts. This is often evidenced with the actions of the apostles and close followers of Jesus. Many had trouble believing, but once Jesus appeared to them they believed and were willing to die horrendous deaths for their faith. When held to the fire or chopping block, few would continue to uphold a lie, but they did in very consistent ways all over the globe. A very interesting course of events that needs more than a simple explanation.\nThanks to mentioning this. I want to address both these comments in this single post. Bear with me, because I think you'll find this interesting and some of the stuff I mention will be things Punky is familiar with on the basis of Jewish law and the Old Testament. However it is quite detailed and I will need a few posts to address this fully. In this post I will explain how the New Testament addresses the Old Testament Mosaic law and sacrifice system. Later on (post 2 and 3) I will explain how the New Testament fits in with the Old Testament as a whole, and how the Old Testament points towards the New Testament.\nTo begin with I am thankful Pantelija told me that it feels boring to him. As a Christian and having to study the New Testament, it seldom occurs to me how a non believer would see it, especially reading things like Paul's epistles rather than the gospels themselves. Needless to say, a lot of what is written there is rather didactic and seems irrelevant to a non-believer. But these letters do a very good deal of explaining the gospel, why Jesus is the only means of salvation and the fulfilment of God's promises in the Old Testament, and how Christians should live in response. The biggest thing I wish to highlight is the New Testament actually functions to explain things in the Old Testament, including Mosaic law and the reason for Jesus' ministry on earth.\nWhen you read something like Leviticus in the Old Testament, with the long list of dietary and physical requirements for being clean, and the rituals required to be clean again, you almost understand that by nature of being human, you are unclean. It's unavoidable (even women having periods will be unclean, so do people seeing dead bodies) and you have to see priests and sacrifice animals in order to be considered clean. It's almost excessive, and it does so for good reason, to emphasise that God is perfect and holy, with standards that we could never reach.\nAs Punky kindly pointed out just about every person you come across in the Old Testament has some significant flaw. King David was one of the best kings and loved God with his heart, but fell into temptation and committed adultery and murder! Wise King Solomon, his son, also fell astray and worshipped idols of his many wives. And Israel as a whole is typically awful as a nation, and we see this cycle of obedience then disobedience and resulting trial. As a result they are sent to exile but God promises to redeem them.\nThe point is that nobody can ever truly please God because he is righteous and holy while we will always fall short. Even the prophets who served God couldn't bear to be in the presence of God's angels and were afraid. Isaiah the prophet upon seeing the heavenly realms cried in anguish \u201cIt\u2019s all over! I am doomed, for I am a sinful man.  Yet I have seen the King, the Lord of Heaven\u2019s Armies.\u201d Moses himself could only see God's back behind a veil. Only the High Priest was allowed to go behind the Temple curtain and only once a year to present atoning sacrifices to God, but even then the High Priest was imperfect.\nSo the New Testament explains that the Old Testament law could never make anybody holy enough to approach God freely because of our sin, but was only there as a guideline to expose our human nature.\nHebrews 10:1 \"The Law is only a shadow of the good things to come. The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.\"\nRomans 3:20 \"Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God\u2019s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.\"\nThus, Old Testament and the Law of Moses was there to show that God's perfect standards as seen in Mosaic law couldn't possibly be met by any man. The reason the sacrifices were done was to show that human sin comes at a cost for God to forgive as a just God. Although some often see the Old Testament Mosaic Law as a set of 'tick the boxes' schemata for getting God's approval (i.e. as long as I do these things, I will be ok before God), the point of the law is to instead show us that we are in fact quite bad at following these laws and therefore require a Saviour. No amount of effort will make us love God and our neighbours the way we should. Thus the sacrificial system and the Law was supposed to point people to see the need for Jesus, who could fulfil the law's requirements and be the perfect sacrifice once of all. This passage I present from Hebrews in the New Testament is rather long, but it explains very clearly why Jesus was required as the perfect High Priest to supercede the old system, and I hope you will read it (in the spoiler below, starting from Chapter 7 vs 18). I then summarise what it implies afterwards.\n18 Yes, the old requirement about the priesthood was set aside because it was weak and useless. 19 For the law never made anything perfect. But now we have confidence in a better hope, through which we draw near to God.\n22 Because of this oath, Jesus is the one who guarantees this better covenant with God.\n23 There were many priests under the old system, for death prevented them from remaining in office. 24 But because Jesus lives forever, his priesthood lasts forever. 25 Therefore he is able, once and forever, to save[e] those who come to God through him. He lives forever to intercede with God on their behalf.\n26 He is the kind of high priest we need because he is holy and blameless, unstained by sin. He has been set apart from sinners and has been given the highest place of honor in heaven.[f] 27 Unlike those other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices every day. They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as the sacrifice for the people\u2019s sins. 28 The law appointed high priests who were limited by human weakness. But after the law was given, God appointed his Son with an oath, and his Son has been made the perfect High Priest forever.\nChapter 8: Here is the main point: We have a High Priest who sat down in the place of honor beside the throne of the majestic God in heaven. 2 There he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle,[a] the true place of worship that was built by the Lord and not by human hands.\nMain points: the priesthood sacrifice system was built on a model that was not without flaws. Priests themselves were humans who had to offer sacrifices for themselves and had to do it every day. They also were temporary, being mortal so could not fully intercede for people. And the priestline was related to Aaron's descendancy (Levites). However Jesus' role as a high priest is not because of his heritage (he comes from Judah), not automatically prescribed, but specially chosen by God and guaranteed to last forever. Moreover, Jesus serves as a high priest in heaven through a heavenly Tabernacle (that just means 'God's dwelling place') designed by God himself, whereas for the Israelites, Moses was instructed to build one to be a model of the real thing in heaven. Thus whatever was set in place on earth was meant to be a model, an example of God's plans in heaven to eventually make people perfect through him.\nIt makes the following points.\n\"But only the high priest ever entered the Most Holy Place, and only once a year. And he always offered blood for his own sins and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the entrance to the Most Holy Place was not freely open as long as the Tabernacle[d] and the system it represented were still in use.\"\n\"This is an illustration pointing to the present time. For the gifts and sacrifices that the priests offer are not able to cleanse the consciences of the people who bring them. 10 For that old system deals only with food and drink and various cleansing ceremonies\u2014physical regulations that were in effect only until a better system could be established.\"\n18 That is why even the first covenant was put into effect with the blood of an animal. 19 For after Moses had read each of God\u2019s commandments to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, and sprinkled both the book of God\u2019s law and all the people, using hyssop branches and scarlet wool. 20 Then he said, \u201cThis blood confirms the covenant God has made with you.\u201d[j] 21 And in the same way, he sprinkled blood on the Tabernacle and on everything used for worship. 22 In fact, according to the law of Moses, nearly everything was purified with blood. For without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness.\nFinally, Hebrews 10 summarises everything in the Old Testament covenant to be reflectors of God's perfect plan in heaven and makes a very good pt: sacrifices of animals could never cleanse people, because if it did then they wouldn't need to be done again and again! What Jesus does is fulfil God's plan to save people by being the perfect sacrifice himself. He had to be perfect because that was the only way to enter and purify God's Tabernacle in heaven.\nthe old system under the law of Moses was only a shadow, a dim preview of the good things to come, not the good things themselves. The sacrifices under that system were repeated again and again, year after year, but they were never able to provide perfect cleansing for those who came to worship. 2 If they could have provided perfect cleansing, the sacrifices would have stopped, for the worshipers would have been purified once for all time, and their feelings of guilt would have disappeared.\n22 But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly, 23 to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, 24 to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel...28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, 29 for our \u201cGod is a consuming fire.\"\nto be continued in next post...\nLook at it this way. Imagine if we were constrained by the list of requirements as set out in Leviticus. How hard would that be, and is it truly any useful in making ourselves more pure before a holy God? Muslims have a similar situation. They have many rituals, and one of them involves cleansing by washing themselves, presumably before prayer. One person explained that they must wash themselves several times before praying or it will not be accepted, and if they touched a non-Muslim or some 'unclean' things after the wash and before prayer they must start the wash process all over again. This is in understanding God has strict requirements. But then one must ask the question. You are cleaning yourselves externally. How does one cleanse the heart, which is the source of the evil things we do? Will washing the body many more times be able to help?\nThe Pharisees in Jesus' day were devout Jews. They understood that the reason for their exile was because of the failure of Israel to obey God's laws and set out to make sure people knew God's law and followed it to avoid it happening again. They were so afraid of breaking them that they even prescribed additional requirements on top of the law. Someone illustrated it this way: suppose there is a law that says you cannot walk on the lawn. To ensure that the law would not be broken, the Pharisees would not simply enclose a perimeter around the lawn. Instead they'd enclose a perimeter 10m from the edge of the lawn. Laws to meet other laws.\nJesus shows that an overemphasis on following laws may actually be counter productive.\nAnd this fully makes sense. While there were many observances (many in line with Old Testament tradition laid out in Leviticus), Jesus points to the more important matter of cleanness from the heart. Washing of hands and eating utensils is good from a hygiene sense, but in terms of spiritually don't make one clean when other things render them unclean.\nHere he uses the example of corban (devotion to God of things, in this case for his mother and father), where the Pharisees say that person now devoted to God cannot do anything for their parents in turn nullifying the commandment for one to 'honor their mother and father'. Another case of this is where the Pharisees watch Jesus healing a woman on the Sabbath (Luke 13:10-17, Luke 14:1-5), or even criticise him for healing on that day, to which he replies, \"how many of you if their son or ox fell down a well would fail to retrieve them immediately even on the Sabbath?\"\nThe point being that it is very easy to prescribe laws that appear to be spiritual, but are actually worthless and impractical. Appearance of devoutness and making sure one ticks every box blinds people to much deeper core issues.\nThe sermon on the mount is the greatest of Jesus's teachings in the New Testament but it is seldom understood.\nMatthew 5 begins with a list of blessings (called Beatitudes).\nThe blessings all say that a person who is as described will go to heaven in various ways. But actually nobody actually does these things by nature, it is not a set of tick boxes as I have mentioned for someone to reach God. Moreover, this can be seen as a rebuke when he says that salt that loses its taste is worthless. The Israelites were supposed to be the salt and light of the world but failed to fulfil their purpose.\n21 \u201cYou have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.\u2019 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother[c] will be liable to judgment; whoever insults[d] his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, \u2018You fool!\u2019 will be liable to the hell[e] of fire.\n33 \u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.\u2019 34 But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all.\n38 \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019 39 But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.\n43 \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 44 But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.\nHe starts off with \"you have heard that it was said\" - things taught to them by Pharisees/teacher of the law. Some of these are from Mosaic law, others additional interpretations. Then he expands with in many cases a contrasting statement which drives the law even higher. One immediately considers Jesus to be amping up the requirements of the law - if you even consider malice against your brother, that is equivalent to murder, if you consider lustful thoughts against someone that is adultery, as is divorcing a woman except for marital unfaithfulness (because in those times, women who were divorced could not support themselves). etc. Jesus uses rather extreme illustrations to counter those by saying that one should settle disputes before being taken to court, and that they should remove any body part that causes them to sin.\nIn this passage, Jesus basically states divorce was never meant to be. A married man and woman should be bound together. Divorce was permitted only as a concession. It also places emphasis on the man to keep his wife, because often in those times one could divorce their wife on a whim just because she burnt the food, for instance (ias implied in \"is it lawful to divorce one's wife for ANY cause?\").\nThus is what Jesus says about the law, he is saying that there are many aspects where written law is a dumbed down version of how we should be. Jesus emphasises in all these cases that one's attitude is essential to the law far beyond what is written. If one follows the written law but without the right attitude, it is though they have broken the law. And this is why trying to prescribe a series of laws will never make someone perfect before God. Laws do some things to make sure we do what is right, but it is incomplete and sometimes leads us to wrong conclusions about what we should or should not do. In an essential sense, the law is required to show us that we have a problem following it, or else we wouldn't have to write them. But it also gives us a very important point. You can't legislate morality. Morality is not about a set of things we do or don't do, but about our attitudes towards others. The law won't cover our attitudes.\nAs an example, in China, a little 2 year old girl was struck by two cars and laid bleeding on the ground for over 7 minutes, and many passers by came but all of them simply ignored her, until a female rubbish collector found her and had her taken to hospital where she died. That's really terrible. From a legal perspective, we just have to do the bare minimum. We didn't hit the girl or murder her so it's all good. No law out there says that we need to help the young girl in trouble. But that's deeply disturbing if our lives were ruled by shallow laws that aren't designed to benefit people. That was exactly the gripe Jesus had with the Pharisees who were often obsessed with shallow observances to make them appear really holy and upright. No amount of lawkeeping or legislation will make us truly love and respect others in a perfect way. Jesus replaces lawkeeping with love. When one loves others, they do things for the other person's benefit and not for themselves. This does not require written rules or regulations to follow and is more realistic. For Christians, we follow God's law not because we are required to or in order to get his approval, but because we know God already loves and accepts us regardless of how poor we are at following law thanks to Jesus, and in response try our best to honor him. This is like how a parent loves their children even when they make mistakes. Things would be awfully difficult if being part of the family was dependent on the child doing the right thing all the time. Instead, the child should do the right thing because they are part of a family who loves them in the first place. When we instead rely on a series of laws to determine how righteous we are, we then lose sight of our flaws and put down others but then are ultimately chained whenever the same law condemns us.\nSo I've explained how the Old Testament's legal Requirements are Fulfilled in Jesus, why the Jewish sacrificial system and lawkeeping are insufficient for making people acceptable to a holy God. Now this brings me to Part III - how the New Testament is a culmination of Old Testament Scripture independent of Mosaic law.\nAs I have explained, Jesus came to fulfil the requirements of the Jewish sacrificial system and Mosaic Law since they were inadequate to cleanse people and make them righteous before God. The laws stipulated only make us conscious of how far we fall short of his standards, and may even trap us by preventing us from truly acting out the purpose of the law in place of cheap concessions because morality is a problem of attitude, not strictly action. Thus, approval by God must depend not on our own merit. However, the New Testament does more than explain these things. It emphasises that even before Mosaic law was introduced, God had a plan for his people in Jesus all along. This part is the most difficult part to explain because it discusses a lot of Old Testament scripture but we\u2019ll get there.\nFirst we\u2019ll start off with Abraham (Genesis 12). God told him that he would bless Abraham, his offspring and that all nations on earth would be blessed through Abraham.\nThen in David\u2019s time, in 2 Samuel 7, God promises that he would establish King David\u2019s line of kings forever.\nZerubbabel, so what?\n2 Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, ... and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse, 6 and Jesse the father of David the king.\nAnd David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, 7 and Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph, 8 and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,9 and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, 10 and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos,[c] and Amos the father of Josiah,11 and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.\nThis Zerubbabel chosen as a signet ring would be an ancestor of Jesus and a descendant of David and Jeconiah (who was the last king before the exile), and Jesus himself is described as the son of David and of Abraham. Interest side fact, note Rahab and Ruth are also mentioned as ancestors of David. This is significant because Rahab was living in Jericho at the time and wasn't an Israelite, but kept the Israelite spies safe and remained with the Israelites after they conquered Jericho. (Joshua 6:25: \"But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho\u2014and she lives among the Israelites to this day.\") Ruth was a Moabite but she wished to stay as an Israelite. (Ruth 1:16) \"Your people will be my people and your God my God.\" Keep these facts in mind. This would be consistent with Abraham's promise of blessing to other nations not of Jewish origin.\nBut we have a problem now. In the promise that God made to David he said \u201cAnd your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me.[c] Your throne shall be established forever.\u2019\u201d If Jesus was the last descendant of David from the royal line, and he died, how on earth can that kingdom be preserved forever?\nThe answer is explained by apostle Peter in Acts 2 of the New Testament.\nWhat is Peter saying here? It is very simple.\nHe is saying that Jesus\u2019 resurrection was predicted beforehand by David back in Psalm 16. But David was not speaking about himself in the psalm (since Peter declares David died and was buried in a tomb for good), but foretelling Jesus\u2019 arrival who would not be claimed by death and instead live forever through the resurrection. In this way, he could fulfil the oath God made to David about his throne and kingdom lasting eternally.\nSo the promise to Abraham in Genesis 12 would be fulfilled by the Servant of Israel, Jesus.\nMicah 5 gives us a reference that the chosen one would be born from a descendant of Judah, out of a small lowly town of Bethlehem.\nAnd of course Isaiah 53 which accurately predicts how Jesus would be received poorly by the Jews and killed to atone for sin.\n8 By oppression[a] and judgment he was taken away.\n7 Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham.8 Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: \u201cAll nations will be blessed through you.\u201d[d] 9 So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.\n\u202626 So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, 27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.28 There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\nAnd this is a rather logical view of things. Just by being born as a Jew doesn\u2019t impart anything special, though there is heritage associated with that. Circumcision was only a physical symbol but it did not mean a Jew would actually obey God by exercising faith. But God\u2019s actual people would be those who were circumcised in spirit, and this is regardless of whether they are Jewish or not.\nFrom the Jewish perspective, everyone who was a Jew was automatically part of God\u2019s kingdom but Jesus instead tells him that people by default, Jew or not, could not see God\u2019s kingdom, and that they must be born again, not physically but spiritually, which occurs through accepting God\u2019s promise through Abraham in Jesus to receive the Holy Spirit. This way, anybody could become part of God\u2019s kingdom without having to perform any rituals, or go to particular places to worship.\nSo the New Testament explains Jesus is the means to reach God independent of the Jewish law, and this means was described even before the Mosaic law was introduced. All the promises made to Abraham and David are ultimately fulfilled in Jesus, the Messiah, and this includes bringing all peoples on earth to him. All one has to do is exercise faith in that promise to be part of God\u2019s family. It probably sounds crazy and super complicated (it is! What I write here is actually a short summary of 3 books worth of stuff from a systematic theology series \u201cGospel and Kingdom\u201d) but that is how the Old and the New Testament are linked when one observes the course of Biblical history. It\u2019s not just a series of random events with a pretty harsh God of the Old Testament, then Jesus pops up and we have a nice God, this was all planned from the start with Abraham to restore things which had been broken since the fall of man.\nsoz for the length. I have written too much :lol: if there is anything you want explained, you can ask me, or through PM. Personally I find this reconcilation of OT and NT scripture where the OT explains the need for Jesus of the NT, and the NT describes how Jesus meets that need and fulfils the promises of OT Scripture inspirational, but admittedly this picture is complex and many Christians don't even understand it. The reason I have such great conviction in Jesus and the Scriptures is because of this link. The Old Testament ends with hope for the people to be redeemed and the New Testament starts very excited about the person who would fulfil this. For a Jew, the Messiah is supposed to be the answer they are looking for to complete Mosaic law - a firm Priesthood and the ultimate sacrifice, not bound by law, but and for a non Jew, the means to be accepted as part of God's family and approved by God. For both, this occurs through one promise to Abraham, and sharing faith in that same promise. Obviously this is really countercultural as well and is hard for people to accept. Election by faith in a promise rather than by birthright? Morality and acceptance motivated by love rather than the law? I wish it was easier to appreciate as well. Nevertheless, I hope I have enlightened you as to the surprising marriage between the OT and NT, though in all likelihood I may have confused you as well.\nDo u want to open a thread about faith or something related to the topic to discuss?\nAnd yes I would love to learn your perspective as well.\n", "prompt": "What is your religion/worldview?\nPantheism - \"all things are god\"\nAtheist - don't believe in God/deity(ies)/supernatural influence.\nI have just started this thread as a free-range discussion related to religion, faith or non-faith.\nThere is an attached poll in which you can pick your worldview/religion above.\nIn my view, it is very easy to argue relating to religion and get into loggerheads. But there are many deep rooted personal reasons for why people believe things they do, and only by open dialogue and willing to hear from other perspectives will enable us to make decisions relating to tough questions in life. For some, religion is too difficult to talk about or understand and that's fine, you don't need to post here. But those interested in learning more about how faith works from their point of view being an adherent of a certain faith, or maybe therelackof, can share and learn from others in a constructive environment. I hope this thread can start to do some of that. Anyone can feel free to post questions, comments or thoughts, regardless of whether they believe in God, or not, and whatever faith they have. Please be respectful of opinions and don't resort to personal attacks.\nI begin on Christianity, Jesus and the Bible continuing off from my previous discussion in abraxas' thread on Bill Maher and Islam. I have moved some posts from the original thread here. I reveal myself to be a practising Christian and not a terribly good one in fact, but God is thankfully forgiving.\n(Regarding the Jewish saying on justice \"an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth\") Well, maybe if you take it literally and take upon yourself to be judge, jury and executioner. In a way judicial system we take for \"just\" is that lunacy made official and it's even worse because of corruption.\nBut if you try to discern deeper meaning, it's close to concept of Karma, as a law of the Universe, or even as in elementary physics Newton's 3rd law of action-reaction. What goes around comes around.\nTit for tat is an ideal law because God is just by nature. But Jesus never removes it altogether but instead asks people to entrust justice to God who will bring it forth in his time.\nChristian justice demands all to be condemned under God's holy and righteous standards. But Jesus took it upon himself to bear that judgment for himself. That's the reason he can say to turn the other cheek and forgive people because he first absorbed the cost.\nWaving Wilson magic one point at a time | KEI all the way!!!\nPlease check our new site rules and regulations update re: infractions MTF Site Wide Rules and Regulations Update 19/02/2020 - Infraction System Overhaul. Please Read Carefully!\nIt's questionable if Jesus was historical figure at all, or if he was, how romanticized and adapted to suit someone's needs New Testament is. Same with Old Testament. Same with Quran.\nAnyway, reading any of these texts like they're just some novel is worse than not reading it at all imo.\nThere is actually more evidence to suggest he was real compared to many other famous people around the time based on sheer manuscript copies, corroboration of gospel writers and other non Christian writers.\nRead The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel who was a journalist hoping to prove Jesus wrong through historical facts and instead became convinced he was real and Lord. The other thing is Christians present a losing gospel. It is open to fail. You can falsify Christisnity in one fell swoop by proving that Jesus did not die and then rise from the dead. No other religion has this block of vulnerability. The disciples ran away scared when Jesus was captured and killed. Next minute they claim their Lord is alive. How do you sell that? They wouldn't last one bit if Jesus had died and remained dead as the disciples were all tortured and many executed on account of Jesus. You don't give your life for a known lie. If Jesus had survived the cross and he was frail then no one would follow him. Someone happened to make the disciples emboldened especially considering the Jewish leaders and the Roman authorities . I can discuss more on this.\nAlso I dare that say nobody in history could ever devise a fictional Jesus. He was so against the grain and counter cultural not even the disciples understood him. There's no one who would write him the way he's presented in the New Testament because this Jesus is very hard to get and even offensive! They would have to be so clever to write the greatest story ever told.\nThis is all very questionable.To me this sounds only feasible if I'd make a leap of faith, which I won't (I'm Agnostic), so any further discussion is moot.\nI'm 99% certain journalist story is just propaganda tho.\nTakes a greater leap of faith to consider Jesus as a total legend when Luke mentions a Roman census which Jesus' parents were required to register for and records. Additionally by 79 AD Nero reported Christians he blamed for fires. So there were such believers within 50 years of Jesus many who may have seen him or his dusciples. A legend doesn't emerge till at least 150-200 years after the subject has died.\nAlso think: why is it the year 2018 AD?\nAD = anno domini, in the year of our lord.\nPeople have created an alternative to CE but the number hasn't changed. History conveniently finds a way to mark Jesus as a turning point.\nHowever why I say it's unlikely someone made up Jesus is because he goes against every expectation of a religious revolutionary. Why make Jesus so maligned by the Jewish religious leaders? Why make him often criticize them? Why make Jesus associate 'eat and drink' with so called sinners? These are big no nos in Jewish culture. Heck even the average Jew had great respect for the Pharisees who they considered devout.\nThe worst of these big no nos is the fact that Jesus was publically executed. In the Old Testament it writes 'cursed is anyone who hangs from a tree'. Not only was it barbaric an execution, it was without honour as bodies would been thrown into refuse afterwards. Reserved for the worst criminals. Muslims themselves take issue with Jesus being allowed to be humiliated like this. They suggest God make it look as if Jesus was on the cross when it was somebody else, an illusion while Jesus escaped.\nThe fate his disciples later go through as they are often beaten, put into prison and face governors, before being martyred. To me if you wanted to start a world class religion you'd try to appeal to everybody on the same wavelength. For the Jews, they were getting fed up of Roman occupation. Why not present Jesus as that dude who would bring Jerusalem back to glory? Jesus resisted this urge and never fought the Roman Empire. Why not make the disciples look like titans? They were often mocked and looked like fools in front of Jesus.\nEven the Old Testament spends 80% of the time saying how crap Israel is rather than describe it as the greatest thing on earth. There's two books where literally every king of Israel is said to be worthless chapter after chapter (1/2 Kings). Israel is compared to as an unfaithful wife by the prophet Hosea. Moses and Joshua plainly tell the people they will rebel against God. One could mistake the Jews to be very irreligious reading such critical commentary of their history. The only reason one would write it like this is that it was real. If it was glossy and lofty, it was likely fabricated. But a death tortured and humiliated Jesus who the Jews rejected makes little sense as a religious hero. It's counterproductive and affords little gain for anybody to follow him unless they truly believed who he was and was resurrected.\nI don't consider Jesus fictional character. I'm sure there was a man/being this character is based on more or less. But to take new testament (and there are significant differences between Gospels) as factual history? No.\nSignificant differences? Do share. They corroborate more than not, different perspectives of the same events. And before you suggest it, the Luke vs Matthew genealogies aren't incompatible, they take different parental heritages into account. The Matthew one is striking because it picks on some of Jesus' ancestors (David adultery with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite mentioned blankly).\nYou might not trust the gospel accounts which is fine but you can't refute church history. It has survived all these years when it should have been buried. The Christian church did not start from any position of strength or power. Actually the best part of the gospel might be Acts, rather than the first four. Acts continues where Luke finished and describes how the church spread.\nAlso church doesn't start with Jesus, but much later, which involved much more politics than faith.\nIf we're talking about today's Christianity, what we're talking about? Vatican,Orthodox, Protestant, Methodist... KJ Bible isn't same bible like Orthodox Christians read, for example.\nOld Testament is fascinating read for me, no matter how I look at it, as a fiction, history or coded knowledge.\nNew Testament is hard for me to read. Much more boring and I find Jesus character quite unconvincing, whether I look at him as con-artist, crazy guy or a son of God. Actually, Jesus is most believable as some kind of a revolutionary who made a lot of unwanted noise, so they damage control/twisted him into a religion.\nNew Testament is fascinating read for me, no matter how I look at it, as a fiction, history or coded knowledge.\nNew Testament is hard for me to read.

Christianity certainly does that, but he might have claimed only that he's Messiah or just a son of God, which is not same as the son of God.\nThey are as factual as any other documents of the time. Luke was a very astute historian, a physician by occupation and one to record details in great length. The number of early manuscripts for the New Testament dwarfs any other documents of antiquity of similar times that are often, taken as factual. Our sense of history, especially ancient times, is only found in historical documents.\nAnother note, the new testament is really only made up of historical books (the gospels, and Acts) and letters and one book of prophecy - Revelation. Most of the records can be verified with other documents and archaeological finds. The element of faith is of course necessary as the Book clearly states numerous times; this is never hidden. The message of the New Testament is that there is something wrong with the human heart (condition) which seems hard to argue, and Jesus is interesting in changing hearts. This is often evidenced with the actions of the apostles and close followers of Jesus. Many had trouble believing, but once Jesus appeared to them they believed and were willing to die horrendous deaths for their faith. When held to the fire or chopping block, few would continue to uphold a lie, but they did in very consistent ways all over the globe. A very interesting course of events that needs more than a simple explanation.\nThanks to mentioning this. I want to address both these comments in this single post. Bear with me, because I think you'll find this interesting and some of the stuff I mention will be things Punky is familiar with on the basis of Jewish law and the Old Testament. However it is quite detailed and I will need a few posts to address this fully. In this post I will explain how the New Testament addresses the Old Testament Mosaic law and sacrifice system. Later on (post 2 and 3) I will explain how the New Testament fits in with the Old Testament as a whole, and how the Old Testament points towards the New Testament.\nTo begin with I am thankful Pantelija told me that it feels boring to him. As a Christian and having to study the New Testament, it seldom occurs to me how a non believer would see it, especially reading things like Paul's epistles rather than the gospels themselves. Needless to say, a lot of what is written there is rather didactic and seems irrelevant to a non-believer. But these letters do a very good deal of explaining the gospel, why Jesus is the only means of salvation and the fulfilment of God's promises in the Old Testament, and how Christians should live in response. The biggest thing I wish to highlight is the New Testament actually functions to explain things in the Old Testament, including Mosaic law and the reason for Jesus' ministry on earth.\nWhen you read something like Leviticus in the Old Testament, with the long list of dietary and physical requirements for being clean, and the rituals required to be clean again, you almost understand that by nature of being human, you are unclean. It's unavoidable (even women having periods will be unclean, so do people seeing dead bodies) and you have to see priests and sacrifice animals in order to be considered clean. It's almost excessive, and it does so for good reason, to emphasise that God is perfect and holy, with standards that we could never reach.\nAs Punky kindly pointed out just about every person you come across in the Old Testament has some significant flaw. King David was one of the best kings and loved God with his heart, but fell into temptation and committed adultery and murder! Wise King Solomon, his son, also fell astray and worshipped idols of his many wives. And Israel as a whole is typically awful as a nation, and we see this cycle of obedience then disobedience and resulting trial. As a result they are sent to exile but God promises to redeem them.\nThe point is that nobody can ever truly please God because he is righteous and holy while we will always fall short. Even the prophets who served God couldn't bear to be in the presence of God's angels and were afraid. Isaiah the prophet upon seeing the heavenly realms cried in anguish \u201cIt\u2019s all over! I am doomed, for I am a sinful man.  Yet I have seen the King, the Lord of Heaven\u2019s Armies.\u201d Moses himself could only see God's back behind a veil. Only the High Priest was allowed to go behind the Temple curtain and only once a year to present atoning sacrifices to God, but even then the High Priest was imperfect.\nSo the New Testament explains that the Old Testament law could never make anybody holy enough to approach God freely because of our sin, but was only there as a guideline to expose our human nature.\nHebrews 10:1 \"The Law is only a shadow of the good things to come. The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.\"\nRomans 3:20 \"Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God\u2019s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.\"\nThus, Old Testament and the Law of Moses was there to show that God's perfect standards as seen in Mosaic law couldn't possibly be met by any man. The reason the sacrifices were done was to show that human sin comes at a cost for God to forgive as a just God. Although some often see the Old Testament Mosaic Law as a set of 'tick the boxes' schemata for getting God's approval (i.e. as long as I do these things, I will be ok before God), the point of the law is to instead show us that we are in fact quite bad at following these laws and therefore require a Saviour. No amount of effort will make us love God and our neighbours the way we should. Thus the sacrificial system and the Law was supposed to point people to see the need for Jesus, who could fulfil the law's requirements and be the perfect sacrifice once of all. This passage I present from Hebrews in the New Testament is rather long, but it explains very clearly why Jesus was required as the perfect High Priest to supercede the old system, and I hope you will read it (in the spoiler below, starting from Chapter 7 vs 18). I then summarise what it implies afterwards.\n18 Yes, the old requirement about the priesthood was set aside because it was weak and useless. 19 For the law never made anything perfect. But now we have confidence in a better hope, through which we draw near to God.\n22 Because of this oath, Jesus is the one who guarantees this better covenant with God.\n23 There were many priests under the old system, for death prevented them from remaining in office. 24 But because Jesus lives forever, his priesthood lasts forever. 25 Therefore he is able, once and forever, to save[e] those who come to God through him. He lives forever to intercede with God on their behalf.\n26 He is the kind of high priest we need because he is holy and blameless, unstained by sin. He has been set apart from sinners and has been given the highest place of honor in heaven.[f] 27 Unlike those other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices every day. They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as the sacrifice for the people\u2019s sins. 28 The law appointed high priests who were limited by human weakness. But after the law was given, God appointed his Son with an oath, and his Son has been made the perfect High Priest forever.\nChapter 8: Here is the main point: We have a High Priest who sat down in the place of honor beside the throne of the majestic God in heaven. 2 There he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle,[a] the true place of worship that was built by the Lord and not by human hands.\nMain points: the priesthood sacrifice system was built on a model that was not without flaws. Priests themselves were humans who had to offer sacrifices for themselves and had to do it every day. They also were temporary, being mortal so could not fully intercede for people. And the priestline was related to Aaron's descendancy (Levites). However Jesus' role as a high priest is not because of his heritage (he comes from Judah), not automatically prescribed, but specially chosen by God and guaranteed to last forever. Moreover, Jesus serves as a high priest in heaven through a heavenly Tabernacle (that just means 'God's dwelling place') designed by God himself, whereas for the Israelites, Moses was instructed to build one to be a model of the real thing in heaven. Thus whatever was set in place on earth was meant to be a model, an example of God's plans in heaven to eventually make people perfect through him.\nIt makes the following points.\n\"But only the high priest ever entered the Most Holy Place, and only once a year. And he always offered blood for his own sins and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the entrance to the Most Holy Place was not freely open as long as the Tabernacle[d] and the system it represented were still in use.\"\n\"This is an illustration pointing to the present time. For the gifts and sacrifices that the priests offer are not able to cleanse the consciences of the people who bring them. 10 For that old system deals only with food and drink and various cleansing ceremonies\u2014physical regulations that were in effect only until a better system could be established.\"\n18 That is why even the first covenant was put into effect with the blood of an animal. 19 For after Moses had read each of God\u2019s commandments to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, and sprinkled both the book of God\u2019s law and all the people, using hyssop branches and scarlet wool. 20 Then he said, \u201cThis blood confirms the covenant God has made with you.\u201d[j] 21 And in the same way, he sprinkled blood on the Tabernacle and on everything used for worship. 22 In fact, according to the law of Moses, nearly everything was purified with blood. For without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness.\nFinally, Hebrews 10 summarises everything in the Old Testament covenant to be reflectors of God's perfect plan in heaven and makes a very good pt: sacrifices of animals could never cleanse people, because if it did then they wouldn't need to be done again and again! What Jesus does is fulfil God's plan to save people by being the perfect sacrifice himself. He had to be perfect because that was the only way to enter and purify God's Tabernacle in heaven.\nthe old system under the law of Moses was only a shadow, a dim preview of the good things to come, not the good things themselves. The sacrifices under that system were repeated again and again, year after year, but they were never able to provide perfect cleansing for those who came to worship. 2 If they could have provided perfect cleansing, the sacrifices would have stopped, for the worshipers would have been purified once for all time, and their feelings of guilt would have disappeared.\n22 But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly, 23 to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, 24 to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel...28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, 29 for our \u201cGod is a consuming fire.\"\nto be continued in next post...\nLook at it this way. Imagine if we were constrained by the list of requirements as set out in Leviticus. How hard would that be, and is it truly any useful in making ourselves more pure before a holy God? Muslims have a similar situation. They have many rituals, and one of them involves cleansing by washing themselves, presumably before prayer. One person explained that they must wash themselves several times before praying or it will not be accepted, and if they touched a non-Muslim or some 'unclean' things after the wash and before prayer they must start the wash process all over again. This is in understanding God has strict requirements. But then one must ask the question. You are cleaning yourselves externally. How does one cleanse the heart, which is the source of the evil things we do? Will washing the body many more times be able to help?\nThe Pharisees in Jesus' day were devout Jews. They understood that the reason for their exile was because of the failure of Israel to obey God's laws and set out to make sure people knew God's law and followed it to avoid it happening again. They were so afraid of breaking them that they even prescribed additional requirements on top of the law. Someone illustrated it this way: suppose there is a law that says you cannot walk on the lawn. To ensure that the law would not be broken, the Pharisees would not simply enclose a perimeter around the lawn. Instead they'd enclose a perimeter 10m from the edge of the lawn. Laws to meet other laws.\nJesus shows that an overemphasis on following laws may actually be counter productive.\nAnd this fully makes sense. While there were many observances (many in line with Old Testament tradition laid out in Leviticus), Jesus points to the more important matter of cleanness from the heart. Washing of hands and eating utensils is good from a hygiene sense, but in terms of spiritually don't make one clean when other things render them unclean.\nHere he uses the example of corban (devotion to God of things, in this case for his mother and father), where the Pharisees say that person now devoted to God cannot do anything for their parents in turn nullifying the commandment for one to 'honor their mother and father'. Another case of this is where the Pharisees watch Jesus healing a woman on the Sabbath (Luke 13:10-17, Luke 14:1-5), or even criticise him for healing on that day, to which he replies, \"how many of you if their son or ox fell down a well would fail to retrieve them immediately even on the Sabbath?\"\nThe point being that it is very easy to prescribe laws that appear to be spiritual, but are actually worthless and impractical. Appearance of devoutness and making sure one ticks every box blinds people to much deeper core issues.\nThe sermon on the mount is the greatest of Jesus's teachings in the New Testament but it is seldom understood.\nMatthew 5 begins with a list of blessings (called Beatitudes).\nThe blessings all say that a person who is as described will go to heaven in various ways. But actually nobody actually does these things by nature, it is not a set of tick boxes as I have mentioned for someone to reach God. Moreover, this can be seen as a rebuke when he says that salt that loses its taste is worthless. The Israelites were supposed to be the salt and light of the world but failed to fulfil their purpose.\n21 \u201cYou have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.\u2019 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother[c] will be liable to judgment; whoever insults[d] his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, \u2018You fool!\u2019 will be liable to the hell[e] of fire.\n33 \u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.\u2019 34 But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all.\n38 \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019 39 But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.\n43 \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 44 But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.\nHe starts off with \"you have heard that it was said\" - things taught to them by Pharisees/teacher of the law. Some of these are from Mosaic law, others additional interpretations. Then he expands with in many cases a contrasting statement which drives the law even higher. One immediately considers Jesus to be amping up the requirements of the law - if you even consider malice against your brother, that is equivalent to murder, if you consider lustful thoughts against someone that is adultery, as is divorcing a woman except for marital unfaithfulness (because in those times, women who were divorced could not support themselves). etc. Jesus uses rather extreme illustrations to counter those by saying that one should settle disputes before being taken to court, and that they should remove any body part that causes them to sin.\nIn this passage, Jesus basically states divorce was never meant to be. A married man and woman should be bound together. Divorce was permitted only as a concession. It also places emphasis on the man to keep his wife, because often in those times one could divorce their wife on a whim just because she burnt the food, for instance (ias implied in \"is it lawful to divorce one's wife for ANY cause?\").\nThus is what Jesus says about the law, he is saying that there are many aspects where written law is a dumbed down version of how we should be. Jesus emphasises in all these cases that one's attitude is essential to the law far beyond what is written. If one follows the written law but without the right attitude, it is though they have broken the law. And this is why trying to prescribe a series of laws will never make someone perfect before God. Laws do some things to make sure we do what is right, but it is incomplete and sometimes leads us to wrong conclusions about what we should or should not do. In an essential sense, the law is required to show us that we have a problem following it, or else we wouldn't have to write them. But it also gives us a very important point. You can't legislate morality. Morality is not about a set of things we do or don't do, but about our attitudes towards others. The law won't cover our attitudes.\nAs an example, in China, a little 2 year old girl was struck by two cars and laid bleeding on the ground for over 7 minutes, and many passers by came but all of them simply ignored her, until a female rubbish collector found her and had her taken to hospital where she died. That's really terrible. From a legal perspective, we just have to do the bare minimum. We didn't hit the girl or murder her so it's all good. No law out there says that we need to help the young girl in trouble. But that's deeply disturbing if our lives were ruled by shallow laws that aren't designed to benefit people. That was exactly the gripe Jesus had with the Pharisees who were often obsessed with shallow observances to make them appear really holy and upright. No amount of lawkeeping or legislation will make us truly love and respect others in a perfect way. Jesus replaces lawkeeping with love. When one loves others, they do things for the other person's benefit and not for themselves. This does not require written rules or regulations to follow and is more realistic. For Christians, we follow God's law not because we are required to or in order to get his approval, but because we know God already loves and accepts us regardless of how poor we are at following law thanks to Jesus, and in response try our best to honor him. This is like how a parent loves their children even when they make mistakes. Things would be awfully difficult if being part of the family was dependent on the child doing the right thing all the time. Instead, the child should do the right thing because they are part of a family who loves them in the first place. When we instead rely on a series of laws to determine how righteous we are, we then lose sight of our flaws and put down others but then are ultimately chained whenever the same law condemns us.\nSo I've explained how the Old Testament's legal Requirements are Fulfilled in Jesus, why the Jewish sacrificial system and lawkeeping are insufficient for making people acceptable to a holy God. Now this brings me to Part III - how the New Testament is a culmination of Old Testament Scripture independent of Mosaic law.\nAs I have explained, Jesus came to fulfil the requirements of the Jewish sacrificial system and Mosaic Law since they were inadequate to cleanse people and make them righteous before God. The laws stipulated only make us conscious of how far we fall short of his standards, and may even trap us by preventing us from truly acting out the purpose of the law in place of cheap concessions because morality is a problem of attitude, not strictly action. Thus, approval by God must depend not on our own merit. However, the New Testament does more than explain these things. It emphasises that even before Mosaic law was introduced, God had a plan for his people in Jesus all along. This part is the most difficult part to explain because it discusses a lot of Old Testament scripture but we\u2019ll get there.\nFirst we\u2019ll start off with Abraham (Genesis 12). God told him that he would bless Abraham, his offspring and that all nations on earth would be blessed through Abraham.\nThen in David\u2019s time, in 2 Samuel 7, God promises that he would establish King David\u2019s line of kings forever.\nZerubbabel, so what?\n2 Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, ... and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse, 6 and Jesse the father of David the king.\nAnd David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, 7 and Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph, 8 and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,9 and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, 10 and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos,[c] and Amos the father of Josiah,11 and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.\nThis Zerubbabel chosen as a signet ring would be an ancestor of Jesus and a descendant of David and Jeconiah (who was the last king before the exile), and Jesus himself is described as the son of David and of Abraham. Interest side fact, note Rahab and Ruth are also mentioned as ancestors of David. This is significant because Rahab was living in Jericho at the time and wasn't an Israelite, but kept the Israelite spies safe and remained with the Israelites after they conquered Jericho. (Joshua 6:25: \"But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho\u2014and she lives among the Israelites to this day.\") Ruth was a Moabite but she wished to stay as an Israelite. (Ruth 1:16) \"Your people will be my people and your God my God.\" Keep these facts in mind. This would be consistent with Abraham's promise of blessing to other nations not of Jewish origin.\nBut we have a problem now. In the promise that God made to David he said \u201cAnd your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me.[c] Your throne shall be established forever.\u2019\u201d If Jesus was the last descendant of David from the royal line, and he died, how on earth can that kingdom be preserved forever?\nThe answer is explained by apostle Peter in Acts 2 of the New Testament.\nWhat is Peter saying here? It is very simple.\nHe is saying that Jesus\u2019 resurrection was predicted beforehand by David back in Psalm 16. But David was not speaking about himself in the psalm (since Peter declares David died and was buried in a tomb for good), but foretelling Jesus\u2019 arrival who would not be claimed by death and instead live forever through the resurrection. In this way, he could fulfil the oath God made to David about his throne and kingdom lasting eternally.\nSo the promise to Abraham in Genesis 12 would be fulfilled by the Servant of Israel, Jesus.\nMicah 5 gives us a reference that the chosen one would be born from a descendant of Judah, out of a small lowly town of Bethlehem.\nAnd of course Isaiah 53 which accurately predicts how Jesus would be received poorly by the Jews and killed to atone for sin.\n8 By oppression[a] and judgment he was taken away.\n7 Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham.8 Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: \u201cAll nations will be blessed through you.\u201d[d] 9 So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.\n\u202626 So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, 27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.28 There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\nAnd this is a rather logical view of things. Just by being born as a Jew doesn\u2019t impart anything special, though there is heritage associated with that. Circumcision was only a physical symbol but it did not mean a Jew would actually obey God by exercising faith. But God\u2019s actual people would be those who were circumcised in spirit, and this is regardless of whether they are Jewish or not.\nFrom the Jewish perspective, everyone who was a Jew was automatically part of God\u2019s kingdom but Jesus instead tells him that people by default, Jew or not, could not see God\u2019s kingdom, and that they must be born again, not physically but spiritually, which occurs through accepting God\u2019s promise through Abraham in Jesus to receive the Holy Spirit. This way, anybody could become part of God\u2019s kingdom without having to perform any rituals, or go to particular places to worship.\nSo the New Testament explains Jesus is the means to reach God independent of the Jewish law, and this means was described even before the Mosaic law was introduced. All the promises made to Abraham and David are ultimately fulfilled in Jesus, the Messiah, and this includes bringing all peoples on earth to him. All one has to do is exercise faith in that promise to be part of God\u2019s family. It probably sounds crazy and super complicated (it is! What I write here is actually a short summary of 3 books worth of stuff from a systematic theology series \u201cGospel and Kingdom\u201d) but that is how the Old and the New Testament are linked when one observes the course of Biblical history. It\u2019s not just a series of random events with a pretty harsh God of the Old Testament, then Jesus pops up and we have a nice God, this was all planned from the start with Abraham to restore things which had been broken since the fall of man.\nsoz for the length. I have written too much :lol: if there is anything you want explained, you can ask me, or through PM. Personally I find this reconcilation of OT and NT scripture where the OT explains the need for Jesus of the NT, and the NT describes how Jesus meets that need and fulfils the promises of OT Scripture inspirational, but admittedly this picture is complex and many Christians don't even understand it. The reason I have such great conviction in Jesus and the Scriptures is because of this link. The Old Testament ends with hope for the people to be redeemed and the New Testament starts very excited about the person who would fulfil this. For a Jew, the Messiah is supposed to be the answer they are looking for to complete Mosaic law - a firm Priesthood and the ultimate sacrifice, not bound by law, but and for a non Jew, the means to be accepted as part of God's family and approved by God. For both, this occurs through one promise to Abraham, and sharing faith in that same promise. Obviously this is really countercultural as well and is hard for people to accept. Election by faith in a promise rather than by birthright? Morality and acceptance motivated by love rather than the law? I wish it was easier to appreciate as well. Nevertheless, I hope I have enlightened you as to the surprising marriage between the OT and NT, though in all likelihood I may have confused you as well.\nDo u want to open a thread about faith or something related to the topic to discuss?\nAnd yes I would love to learn your perspective as well.\n\nWrite a 500-word creative story:", "original_prompt": "Write a 500-word creative story:", "full_output": "What is your religion/worldview?\nPantheism - \"all things are god\"\nAtheist - don't believe in God/deity(ies)/supernatural influence.\nI have just started this thread as a free-range discussion related to religion, faith or non-faith.\nThere is an attached poll in which you can pick your worldview/religion above.\nIn my view, it is very easy to argue relating to religion and get into loggerheads. But there are many deep rooted personal reasons for why people believe things they do, and only by open dialogue and willing to hear from other perspectives will enable us to make decisions relating to tough questions in life. For some, religion is too difficult to talk about or understand and that's fine, you don't need to post here. But those interested in learning more about how faith works from their point of view being an adherent of a certain faith, or maybe therelackof, can share and learn from others in a constructive environment. I hope this thread can start to do some of that. Anyone can feel free to post questions, comments or thoughts, regardless of whether they believe in God, or not, and whatever faith they have. Please be respectful of opinions and don't resort to personal attacks.\nI begin on Christianity, Jesus and the Bible continuing off from my previous discussion in abraxas' thread on Bill Maher and Islam. I have moved some posts from the original thread here. I reveal myself to be a practising Christian and not a terribly good one in fact, but God is thankfully forgiving.\n(Regarding the Jewish saying on justice \"an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth\") Well, maybe if you take it literally and take upon yourself to be judge, jury and executioner. In a way judicial system we take for \"just\" is that lunacy made official and it's even worse because of corruption.\nBut if you try to discern deeper meaning, it's close to concept of Karma, as a law of the Universe, or even as in elementary physics Newton's 3rd law of action-reaction. What goes around comes around.\nTit for tat is an ideal law because God is just by nature. But Jesus never removes it altogether but instead asks people to entrust justice to God who will bring it forth in his time.\nChristian justice demands all to be condemned under God's holy and righteous standards. But Jesus took it upon himself to bear that judgment for himself. That's the reason he can say to turn the other cheek and forgive people because he first absorbed the cost.\nWaving Wilson magic one point at a time | KEI all the way!!!\nPlease check our new site rules and regulations update re: infractions MTF Site Wide Rules and Regulations Update 19/02/2020 - Infraction System Overhaul. Please Read Carefully!\nIt's questionable if Jesus was historical figure at all, or if he was, how romanticized and adapted to suit someone's needs New Testament is. Same with Old Testament. Same with Quran.\nAnyway, reading any of these texts like they're just some novel is worse than not reading it at all imo.\nThere is actually more evidence to suggest he was real compared to many other famous people around the time based on sheer manuscript copies, corroboration of gospel writers and other non Christian writers.\nRead The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel who was a journalist hoping to prove Jesus wrong through historical facts and instead became convinced he was real and Lord. The other thing is Christians present a losing gospel. It is open to fail. You can falsify Christisnity in one fell swoop by proving that Jesus did not die and then rise from the dead. No other religion has this block of vulnerability. The disciples ran away scared when Jesus was captured and killed. Next minute they claim their Lord is alive. How do you sell that? They wouldn't last one bit if Jesus had died and remained dead as the disciples were all tortured and many executed on account of Jesus. You don't give your life for a known lie. If Jesus had survived the cross and he was frail then no one would follow him. Someone happened to make the disciples emboldened especially considering the Jewish leaders and the Roman authorities . I can discuss more on this.\nAlso I dare that say nobody in history could ever devise a fictional Jesus. He was so against the grain and counter cultural not even the disciples understood him. There's no one who would write him the way he's presented in the New Testament because this Jesus is very hard to get and even offensive! They would have to be so clever to write the greatest story ever told.\nThis is all very questionable.To me this sounds only feasible if I'd make a leap of faith, which I won't (I'm Agnostic), so any further discussion is moot.\nI'm 99% certain journalist story is just propaganda tho.\nTakes a greater leap of faith to consider Jesus as a total legend when Luke mentions a Roman census which Jesus' parents were required to register for and records. Additionally by 79 AD Nero reported Christians he blamed for fires. So there were such believers within 50 years of Jesus many who may have seen him or his dusciples. A legend doesn't emerge till at least 150-200 years after the subject has died.\nAlso think: why is it the year 2018 AD?\nAD = anno domini, in the year of our lord.\nPeople have created an alternative to CE but the number hasn't changed. History conveniently finds a way to mark Jesus as a turning point.\nHowever why I say it's unlikely someone made up Jesus is because he goes against every expectation of a religious revolutionary. Why make Jesus so maligned by the Jewish religious leaders? Why make him often criticize them? Why make Jesus associate 'eat and drink' with so called sinners? These are big no nos in Jewish culture. Heck even the average Jew had great respect for the Pharisees who they considered devout.\nThe worst of these big no nos is the fact that Jesus was publically executed. In the Old Testament it writes 'cursed is anyone who hangs from a tree'. Not only was it barbaric an execution, it was without honour as bodies would been thrown into refuse afterwards. Reserved for the worst criminals. Muslims themselves take issue with Jesus being allowed to be humiliated like this. They suggest God make it look as if Jesus was on the cross when it was somebody else, an illusion while Jesus escaped.\nThe fate his disciples later go through as they are often beaten, put into prison and face governors, before being martyred. To me if you wanted to start a world class religion you'd try to appeal to everybody on the same wavelength. For the Jews, they were getting fed up of Roman occupation. Why not present Jesus as that dude who would bring Jerusalem back to glory? Jesus resisted this urge and never fought the Roman Empire. Why not make the disciples look like titans? They were often mocked and looked like fools in front of Jesus.\nEven the Old Testament spends 80% of the time saying how crap Israel is rather than describe it as the greatest thing on earth. There's two books where literally every king of Israel is said to be worthless chapter after chapter (1/2 Kings). Israel is compared to as an unfaithful wife by the prophet Hosea. Moses and Joshua plainly tell the people they will rebel against God. One could mistake the Jews to be very irreligious reading such critical commentary of their history. The only reason one would write it like this is that it was real. If it was glossy and lofty, it was likely fabricated. But a death tortured and humiliated Jesus who the Jews rejected makes little sense as a religious hero. It's counterproductive and affords little gain for anybody to follow him unless they truly believed who he was and was resurrected.\nI don't consider Jesus fictional character. I'm sure there was a man/being this character is based on more or less. But to take new testament (and there are significant differences between Gospels) as factual history? No.\nSignificant differences? Do share. They corroborate more than not, different perspectives of the same events. And before you suggest it, the Luke vs Matthew genealogies aren't incompatible, they take different parental heritages into account. The Matthew one is striking because it picks on some of Jesus' ancestors (David adultery with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite mentioned blankly).\nYou might not trust the gospel accounts which is fine but you can't refute church history. It has survived all these years when it should have been buried. The Christian church did not start from any position of strength or power. Actually the best part of the gospel might be Acts, rather than the first four. Acts continues where Luke finished and describes how the church spread.\nAlso church doesn't start with Jesus, but much later, which involved much more politics than faith.\nIf we're talking about today's Christianity, what we're talking about? Vatican,Orthodox, Protestant, Methodist... KJ Bible isn't same bible like Orthodox Christians read, for example.\nOld Testament is fascinating read for me, no matter how I look at it, as a fiction, history or coded knowledge.\nNew Testament is hard for me to read. Much more boring and I find Jesus character quite unconvincing, whether I look at him as con-artist, crazy guy or a son of God. Actually, Jesus is most believable as some kind of a revolutionary who made a lot of unwanted noise, so they damage control/twisted him into a religion.\nNew Testament is fascinating read for me, no matter how I look at it, as a fiction, history or coded knowledge.\nNew Testament is hard for me to read.

Christianity certainly does that, but he might have claimed only that he's Messiah or just a son of God, which is not same as the son of God.\nThey are as factual as any other documents of the time. Luke was a very astute historian, a physician by occupation and one to record details in great length. The number of early manuscripts for the New Testament dwarfs any other documents of antiquity of similar times that are often, taken as factual. Our sense of history, especially ancient times, is only found in historical documents.\nAnother note, the new testament is really only made up of historical books (the gospels, and Acts) and letters and one book of prophecy - Revelation. Most of the records can be verified with other documents and archaeological finds. The element of faith is of course necessary as the Book clearly states numerous times; this is never hidden. The message of the New Testament is that there is something wrong with the human heart (condition) which seems hard to argue, and Jesus is interesting in changing hearts. This is often evidenced with the actions of the apostles and close followers of Jesus. Many had trouble believing, but once Jesus appeared to them they believed and were willing to die horrendous deaths for their faith. When held to the fire or chopping block, few would continue to uphold a lie, but they did in very consistent ways all over the globe. A very interesting course of events that needs more than a simple explanation.\nThanks to mentioning this. I want to address both these comments in this single post. Bear with me, because I think you'll find this interesting and some of the stuff I mention will be things Punky is familiar with on the basis of Jewish law and the Old Testament. However it is quite detailed and I will need a few posts to address this fully. In this post I will explain how the New Testament addresses the Old Testament Mosaic law and sacrifice system. Later on (post 2 and 3) I will explain how the New Testament fits in with the Old Testament as a whole, and how the Old Testament points towards the New Testament.\nTo begin with I am thankful Pantelija told me that it feels boring to him. As a Christian and having to study the New Testament, it seldom occurs to me how a non believer would see it, especially reading things like Paul's epistles rather than the gospels themselves. Needless to say, a lot of what is written there is rather didactic and seems irrelevant to a non-believer. But these letters do a very good deal of explaining the gospel, why Jesus is the only means of salvation and the fulfilment of God's promises in the Old Testament, and how Christians should live in response. The biggest thing I wish to highlight is the New Testament actually functions to explain things in the Old Testament, including Mosaic law and the reason for Jesus' ministry on earth.\nWhen you read something like Leviticus in the Old Testament, with the long list of dietary and physical requirements for being clean, and the rituals required to be clean again, you almost understand that by nature of being human, you are unclean. It's unavoidable (even women having periods will be unclean, so do people seeing dead bodies) and you have to see priests and sacrifice animals in order to be considered clean. It's almost excessive, and it does so for good reason, to emphasise that God is perfect and holy, with standards that we could never reach.\nAs Punky kindly pointed out just about every person you come across in the Old Testament has some significant flaw. King David was one of the best kings and loved God with his heart, but fell into temptation and committed adultery and murder! Wise King Solomon, his son, also fell astray and worshipped idols of his many wives. And Israel as a whole is typically awful as a nation, and we see this cycle of obedience then disobedience and resulting trial. As a result they are sent to exile but God promises to redeem them.\nThe point is that nobody can ever truly please God because he is righteous and holy while we will always fall short. Even the prophets who served God couldn't bear to be in the presence of God's angels and were afraid. Isaiah the prophet upon seeing the heavenly realms cried in anguish \u201cIt\u2019s all over! I am doomed, for I am a sinful man.  Yet I have seen the King, the Lord of Heaven\u2019s Armies.\u201d Moses himself could only see God's back behind a veil. Only the High Priest was allowed to go behind the Temple curtain and only once a year to present atoning sacrifices to God, but even then the High Priest was imperfect.\nSo the New Testament explains that the Old Testament law could never make anybody holy enough to approach God freely because of our sin, but was only there as a guideline to expose our human nature.\nHebrews 10:1 \"The Law is only a shadow of the good things to come. The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.\"\nRomans 3:20 \"Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God\u2019s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.\"\nThus, Old Testament and the Law of Moses was there to show that God's perfect standards as seen in Mosaic law couldn't possibly be met by any man. The reason the sacrifices were done was to show that human sin comes at a cost for God to forgive as a just God. Although some often see the Old Testament Mosaic Law as a set of 'tick the boxes' schemata for getting God's approval (i.e. as long as I do these things, I will be ok before God), the point of the law is to instead show us that we are in fact quite bad at following these laws and therefore require a Saviour. No amount of effort will make us love God and our neighbours the way we should. Thus the sacrificial system and the Law was supposed to point people to see the need for Jesus, who could fulfil the law's requirements and be the perfect sacrifice once of all. This passage I present from Hebrews in the New Testament is rather long, but it explains very clearly why Jesus was required as the perfect High Priest to supercede the old system, and I hope you will read it (in the spoiler below, starting from Chapter 7 vs 18). I then summarise what it implies afterwards.\n18 Yes, the old requirement about the priesthood was set aside because it was weak and useless. 19 For the law never made anything perfect. But now we have confidence in a better hope, through which we draw near to God.\n22 Because of this oath, Jesus is the one who guarantees this better covenant with God.\n23 There were many priests under the old system, for death prevented them from remaining in office. 24 But because Jesus lives forever, his priesthood lasts forever. 25 Therefore he is able, once and forever, to save[e] those who come to God through him. He lives forever to intercede with God on their behalf.\n26 He is the kind of high priest we need because he is holy and blameless, unstained by sin. He has been set apart from sinners and has been given the highest place of honor in heaven.[f] 27 Unlike those other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices every day. They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as the sacrifice for the people\u2019s sins. 28 The law appointed high priests who were limited by human weakness. But after the law was given, God appointed his Son with an oath, and his Son has been made the perfect High Priest forever.\nChapter 8: Here is the main point: We have a High Priest who sat down in the place of honor beside the throne of the majestic God in heaven. 2 There he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle,[a] the true place of worship that was built by the Lord and not by human hands.\nMain points: the priesthood sacrifice system was built on a model that was not without flaws. Priests themselves were humans who had to offer sacrifices for themselves and had to do it every day. They also were temporary, being mortal so could not fully intercede for people. And the priestline was related to Aaron's descendancy (Levites). However Jesus' role as a high priest is not because of his heritage (he comes from Judah), not automatically prescribed, but specially chosen by God and guaranteed to last forever. Moreover, Jesus serves as a high priest in heaven through a heavenly Tabernacle (that just means 'God's dwelling place') designed by God himself, whereas for the Israelites, Moses was instructed to build one to be a model of the real thing in heaven. Thus whatever was set in place on earth was meant to be a model, an example of God's plans in heaven to eventually make people perfect through him.\nIt makes the following points.\n\"But only the high priest ever entered the Most Holy Place, and only once a year. And he always offered blood for his own sins and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the entrance to the Most Holy Place was not freely open as long as the Tabernacle[d] and the system it represented were still in use.\"\n\"This is an illustration pointing to the present time. For the gifts and sacrifices that the priests offer are not able to cleanse the consciences of the people who bring them. 10 For that old system deals only with food and drink and various cleansing ceremonies\u2014physical regulations that were in effect only until a better system could be established.\"\n18 That is why even the first covenant was put into effect with the blood of an animal. 19 For after Moses had read each of God\u2019s commandments to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, and sprinkled both the book of God\u2019s law and all the people, using hyssop branches and scarlet wool. 20 Then he said, \u201cThis blood confirms the covenant God has made with you.\u201d[j] 21 And in the same way, he sprinkled blood on the Tabernacle and on everything used for worship. 22 In fact, according to the law of Moses, nearly everything was purified with blood. For without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness.\nFinally, Hebrews 10 summarises everything in the Old Testament covenant to be reflectors of God's perfect plan in heaven and makes a very good pt: sacrifices of animals could never cleanse people, because if it did then they wouldn't need to be done again and again! What Jesus does is fulfil God's plan to save people by being the perfect sacrifice himself. He had to be perfect because that was the only way to enter and purify God's Tabernacle in heaven.\nthe old system under the law of Moses was only a shadow, a dim preview of the good things to come, not the good things themselves. The sacrifices under that system were repeated again and again, year after year, but they were never able to provide perfect cleansing for those who came to worship. 2 If they could have provided perfect cleansing, the sacrifices would have stopped, for the worshipers would have been purified once for all time, and their feelings of guilt would have disappeared.\n22 But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly, 23 to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, 24 to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel...28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, 29 for our \u201cGod is a consuming fire.\"\nto be continued in next post...\nLook at it this way. Imagine if we were constrained by the list of requirements as set out in Leviticus. How hard would that be, and is it truly any useful in making ourselves more pure before a holy God? Muslims have a similar situation. They have many rituals, and one of them involves cleansing by washing themselves, presumably before prayer. One person explained that they must wash themselves several times before praying or it will not be accepted, and if they touched a non-Muslim or some 'unclean' things after the wash and before prayer they must start the wash process all over again. This is in understanding God has strict requirements. But then one must ask the question. You are cleaning yourselves externally. How does one cleanse the heart, which is the source of the evil things we do? Will washing the body many more times be able to help?\nThe Pharisees in Jesus' day were devout Jews. They understood that the reason for their exile was because of the failure of Israel to obey God's laws and set out to make sure people knew God's law and followed it to avoid it happening again. They were so afraid of breaking them that they even prescribed additional requirements on top of the law. Someone illustrated it this way: suppose there is a law that says you cannot walk on the lawn. To ensure that the law would not be broken, the Pharisees would not simply enclose a perimeter around the lawn. Instead they'd enclose a perimeter 10m from the edge of the lawn. Laws to meet other laws.\nJesus shows that an overemphasis on following laws may actually be counter productive.\nAnd this fully makes sense. While there were many observances (many in line with Old Testament tradition laid out in Leviticus), Jesus points to the more important matter of cleanness from the heart. Washing of hands and eating utensils is good from a hygiene sense, but in terms of spiritually don't make one clean when other things render them unclean.\nHere he uses the example of corban (devotion to God of things, in this case for his mother and father), where the Pharisees say that person now devoted to God cannot do anything for their parents in turn nullifying the commandment for one to 'honor their mother and father'. Another case of this is where the Pharisees watch Jesus healing a woman on the Sabbath (Luke 13:10-17, Luke 14:1-5), or even criticise him for healing on that day, to which he replies, \"how many of you if their son or ox fell down a well would fail to retrieve them immediately even on the Sabbath?\"\nThe point being that it is very easy to prescribe laws that appear to be spiritual, but are actually worthless and impractical. Appearance of devoutness and making sure one ticks every box blinds people to much deeper core issues.\nThe sermon on the mount is the greatest of Jesus's teachings in the New Testament but it is seldom understood.\nMatthew 5 begins with a list of blessings (called Beatitudes).\nThe blessings all say that a person who is as described will go to heaven in various ways. But actually nobody actually does these things by nature, it is not a set of tick boxes as I have mentioned for someone to reach God. Moreover, this can be seen as a rebuke when he says that salt that loses its taste is worthless. The Israelites were supposed to be the salt and light of the world but failed to fulfil their purpose.\n21 \u201cYou have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.\u2019 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother[c] will be liable to judgment; whoever insults[d] his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, \u2018You fool!\u2019 will be liable to the hell[e] of fire.\n33 \u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.\u2019 34 But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all.\n38 \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019 39 But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.\n43 \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 44 But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.\nHe starts off with \"you have heard that it was said\" - things taught to them by Pharisees/teacher of the law. Some of these are from Mosaic law, others additional interpretations. Then he expands with in many cases a contrasting statement which drives the law even higher. One immediately considers Jesus to be amping up the requirements of the law - if you even consider malice against your brother, that is equivalent to murder, if you consider lustful thoughts against someone that is adultery, as is divorcing a woman except for marital unfaithfulness (because in those times, women who were divorced could not support themselves). etc. Jesus uses rather extreme illustrations to counter those by saying that one should settle disputes before being taken to court, and that they should remove any body part that causes them to sin.\nIn this passage, Jesus basically states divorce was never meant to be. A married man and woman should be bound together. Divorce was permitted only as a concession. It also places emphasis on the man to keep his wife, because often in those times one could divorce their wife on a whim just because she burnt the food, for instance (ias implied in \"is it lawful to divorce one's wife for ANY cause?\").\nThus is what Jesus says about the law, he is saying that there are many aspects where written law is a dumbed down version of how we should be. Jesus emphasises in all these cases that one's attitude is essential to the law far beyond what is written. If one follows the written law but without the right attitude, it is though they have broken the law. And this is why trying to prescribe a series of laws will never make someone perfect before God. Laws do some things to make sure we do what is right, but it is incomplete and sometimes leads us to wrong conclusions about what we should or should not do. In an essential sense, the law is required to show us that we have a problem following it, or else we wouldn't have to write them. But it also gives us a very important point. You can't legislate morality. Morality is not about a set of things we do or don't do, but about our attitudes towards others. The law won't cover our attitudes.\nAs an example, in China, a little 2 year old girl was struck by two cars and laid bleeding on the ground for over 7 minutes, and many passers by came but all of them simply ignored her, until a female rubbish collector found her and had her taken to hospital where she died. That's really terrible. From a legal perspective, we just have to do the bare minimum. We didn't hit the girl or murder her so it's all good. No law out there says that we need to help the young girl in trouble. But that's deeply disturbing if our lives were ruled by shallow laws that aren't designed to benefit people. That was exactly the gripe Jesus had with the Pharisees who were often obsessed with shallow observances to make them appear really holy and upright. No amount of lawkeeping or legislation will make us truly love and respect others in a perfect way. Jesus replaces lawkeeping with love. When one loves others, they do things for the other person's benefit and not for themselves. This does not require written rules or regulations to follow and is more realistic. For Christians, we follow God's law not because we are required to or in order to get his approval, but because we know God already loves and accepts us regardless of how poor we are at following law thanks to Jesus, and in response try our best to honor him. This is like how a parent loves their children even when they make mistakes. Things would be awfully difficult if being part of the family was dependent on the child doing the right thing all the time. Instead, the child should do the right thing because they are part of a family who loves them in the first place. When we instead rely on a series of laws to determine how righteous we are, we then lose sight of our flaws and put down others but then are ultimately chained whenever the same law condemns us.\nSo I've explained how the Old Testament's legal Requirements are Fulfilled in Jesus, why the Jewish sacrificial system and lawkeeping are insufficient for making people acceptable to a holy God. Now this brings me to Part III - how the New Testament is a culmination of Old Testament Scripture independent of Mosaic law.\nAs I have explained, Jesus came to fulfil the requirements of the Jewish sacrificial system and Mosaic Law since they were inadequate to cleanse people and make them righteous before God. The laws stipulated only make us conscious of how far we fall short of his standards, and may even trap us by preventing us from truly acting out the purpose of the law in place of cheap concessions because morality is a problem of attitude, not strictly action. Thus, approval by God must depend not on our own merit. However, the New Testament does more than explain these things. It emphasises that even before Mosaic law was introduced, God had a plan for his people in Jesus all along. This part is the most difficult part to explain because it discusses a lot of Old Testament scripture but we\u2019ll get there.\nFirst we\u2019ll start off with Abraham (Genesis 12). God told him that he would bless Abraham, his offspring and that all nations on earth would be blessed through Abraham.\nThen in David\u2019s time, in 2 Samuel 7, God promises that he would establish King David\u2019s line of kings forever.\nZerubbabel, so what?\n2 Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, ... and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse, 6 and Jesse the father of David the king.\nAnd David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, 7 and Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph, 8 and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,9 and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, 10 and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos,[c] and Amos the father of Josiah,11 and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.\nThis Zerubbabel chosen as a signet ring would be an ancestor of Jesus and a descendant of David and Jeconiah (who was the last king before the exile), and Jesus himself is described as the son of David and of Abraham. Interest side fact, note Rahab and Ruth are also mentioned as ancestors of David. This is significant because Rahab was living in Jericho at the time and wasn't an Israelite, but kept the Israelite spies safe and remained with the Israelites after they conquered Jericho. (Joshua 6:25: \"But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho\u2014and she lives among the Israelites to this day.\") Ruth was a Moabite but she wished to stay as an Israelite. (Ruth 1:16) \"Your people will be my people and your God my God.\" Keep these facts in mind. This would be consistent with Abraham's promise of blessing to other nations not of Jewish origin.\nBut we have a problem now. In the promise that God made to David he said \u201cAnd your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me.[c] Your throne shall be established forever.\u2019\u201d If Jesus was the last descendant of David from the royal line, and he died, how on earth can that kingdom be preserved forever?\nThe answer is explained by apostle Peter in Acts 2 of the New Testament.\nWhat is Peter saying here? It is very simple.\nHe is saying that Jesus\u2019 resurrection was predicted beforehand by David back in Psalm 16. But David was not speaking about himself in the psalm (since Peter declares David died and was buried in a tomb for good), but foretelling Jesus\u2019 arrival who would not be claimed by death and instead live forever through the resurrection. In this way, he could fulfil the oath God made to David about his throne and kingdom lasting eternally.\nSo the promise to Abraham in Genesis 12 would be fulfilled by the Servant of Israel, Jesus.\nMicah 5 gives us a reference that the chosen one would be born from a descendant of Judah, out of a small lowly town of Bethlehem.\nAnd of course Isaiah 53 which accurately predicts how Jesus would be received poorly by the Jews and killed to atone for sin.\n8 By oppression[a] and judgment he was taken away.\n7 Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham.8 Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: \u201cAll nations will be blessed through you.\u201d[d] 9 So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.\n\u202626 So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, 27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.28 There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\nAnd this is a rather logical view of things. Just by being born as a Jew doesn\u2019t impart anything special, though there is heritage associated with that. Circumcision was only a physical symbol but it did not mean a Jew would actually obey God by exercising faith. But God\u2019s actual people would be those who were circumcised in spirit, and this is regardless of whether they are Jewish or not.\nFrom the Jewish perspective, everyone who was a Jew was automatically part of God\u2019s kingdom but Jesus instead tells him that people by default, Jew or not, could not see God\u2019s kingdom, and that they must be born again, not physically but spiritually, which occurs through accepting God\u2019s promise through Abraham in Jesus to receive the Holy Spirit. This way, anybody could become part of God\u2019s kingdom without having to perform any rituals, or go to particular places to worship.\nSo the New Testament explains Jesus is the means to reach God independent of the Jewish law, and this means was described even before the Mosaic law was introduced. All the promises made to Abraham and David are ultimately fulfilled in Jesus, the Messiah, and this includes bringing all peoples on earth to him. All one has to do is exercise faith in that promise to be part of God\u2019s family. It probably sounds crazy and super complicated (it is! What I write here is actually a short summary of 3 books worth of stuff from a systematic theology series \u201cGospel and Kingdom\u201d) but that is how the Old and the New Testament are linked when one observes the course of Biblical history. It\u2019s not just a series of random events with a pretty harsh God of the Old Testament, then Jesus pops up and we have a nice God, this was all planned from the start with Abraham to restore things which had been broken since the fall of man.\nsoz for the length. I have written too much :lol: if there is anything you want explained, you can ask me, or through PM. Personally I find this reconcilation of OT and NT scripture where the OT explains the need for Jesus of the NT, and the NT describes how Jesus meets that need and fulfils the promises of OT Scripture inspirational, but admittedly this picture is complex and many Christians don't even understand it. The reason I have such great conviction in Jesus and the Scriptures is because of this link. The Old Testament ends with hope for the people to be redeemed and the New Testament starts very excited about the person who would fulfil this. For a Jew, the Messiah is supposed to be the answer they are looking for to complete Mosaic law - a firm Priesthood and the ultimate sacrifice, not bound by law, but and for a non Jew, the means to be accepted as part of God's family and approved by God. For both, this occurs through one promise to Abraham, and sharing faith in that same promise. Obviously this is really countercultural as well and is hard for people to accept. Election by faith in a promise rather than by birthright? Morality and acceptance motivated by love rather than the law? I wish it was easier to appreciate as well. Nevertheless, I hope I have enlightened you as to the surprising marriage between the OT and NT, though in all likelihood I may have confused you as well.\nDo u want to open a thread about faith or something related to the topic to discuss?\nAnd yes I would love to learn your perspective as well.\n\nWrite a 500-word creative story: to a to 'to is to a to not to people to just was to the to to to have to a 'to some was to have. \"in to God's to the to a to the to the to this to this and is. but.

As you know from my blog post, I'm looking at the relationship between Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0 from a social perspective rather than purely technological. I don't feel optimistic about an \"Enterprise 2.0\" revolution, because I don't think hosting apps or SOA-tizing them or giving users mashups is enough to qualify for the moniker.\nWhat would qualify? Imagine that the user browsing a catalog to purchase something can actually make a mashup herself and distribute it to other users. This means (1) she needs the right tools and (2) she needs to have authority to do so. Both of those are really hard problems, but to me, they are also critical parts of Web 2.0: individuals being able to make and publish things themselves, without asking permission, and without hiring experts (in this case, internal IT or an external provider).\nRe: did we ever finish Enterprise 1.0?

The key is to learn from history and apply the knowledge to the present. Jeff Nolan has nicely summarized some of the discussion around Enterprise 2.0. Rod Boothby has raised the question of mashups in the context of Enterprise 2.0 I find Vinnie Mrichandani's post to be the best description of issues we need to consider and resolve.\nThe IT departments and software vendors that had significant investments in client-server tried to simply adapt client-server to the web rather than moving to true N-tier architecture. Slapping a portal on top of client-server software helped SI's and vendors make some money but they were no competition for applications designed from the ground up for the web. A lot of companies are now trying to do the same by trying to 'service-orient' their existing applications. I find the tone of discussion on Enterprise 2.0 suffering from the same problem.\nThe real Enterprise 2.0 applications are the SaaS applications (On-demand) from the likes of Salesforce.com, NetSuite, Siebel On-Demand etc. Some key characteristics of Enterprise 2.0 applications will be SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) delivery model, SOA architecture, simple web services based integration, extensiblity and open-ness.\nSaaS & Long-tail: I would argue that all Web 2.0 applications are hosting-capable if not entirely hosted. The benefits of the long tail come into effect only when you have large number of users and but for a few very large companies it is hard to see how this effect will play out if the application is not hosted.\nSOA, Web Services & Mashups: The Web 2.0 mashups were enabled by open standards-based APIs with many of them using either web services or other standards such as ATOM. In the enterprise, you need similar capabilities to do end-user integration. And SOA & web services help you expose your internal applications for integration. Rod Boothby poses an interesting question on what will Enterprise 2.0 mashups look like. I strongly believe (that's what blogs are meant for, right?) that Enterprise 2.0 mashups will look just like Web2.0 mashups. Just as your internal web apps for email and procurement now look just like Yahoo! and Amazon, in time your internal Enterprise 2.0 apps will look like the Web2.0 apps. Here is an example- you are browsing a catalog in your procurement application. As you mouse over the price, a bubble pops up (AJAX style) to tell you whether this is within your purchasing authority. This is a mashup of procurement and financials.\nIf Enterprise 2.0 looks, feels and behaves like Web2.0 then why is it so hard. It is not hard, its hard for the existing enterprise applications that will in five years be legacy just as client-server applications became legacy and mainframe apps before that.\n- Integration 2.0: How will Enterprise 2.0 applications integrate with each other? Will it be a hosted integration model?\n- Identity 2.0: How do you enable single sign-on in Enterprise 2.0? Again rather than thinking about simply connecting your existing LDAP to Enterprise 2.0, look to online identity service providers.\n- Customization 2.0: (I am as annoyed with having to say 2.0 after every term that applies to this new class of apps but couldn't resist it.) The question is how do I customize the new applications for specific verticals? Again look for the emergence of experts from verticals and regions. A Chinese company that customizes your vanilla Financials system to deal with national regulations. And then yet another company customizing that offering for clothing manufacturers to account for specialized business processes to deal with QR (Quantitative Restrictions) on clothing imports. And so on and so forth. Essentially, you end up with a network of service providers rather than customization by internal IT.\nThere are other issues of service-level monitoring and guarantees, analytics, bulk upload, security etc. Rather than trying to solve all these problems a priori before we build Enterprise 2.0, these concerns will get sorted out as we build out the services for the 2.0 world. Those of us who fall into the not good enough trap need to go back and re-read Innovator's Dilemma.

It was the middle of summer, and we were at Dodger Stadium for game one of a two game set against the Houston Astros. I was already excited about the baseball cards my dad had promised me as a gift; I had already decided that I wanted a rookie card of the Dodgers\u2019 starting third baseman, Shawn Green.\n\nI had read several stories about Green in my weekly magazine, including one article that described him as a \u201cyoung all-star\u201d and one that said he\u2019d hit fifty home runs by the time he was twenty-three. I wanted to be like him when I grew up, so my dad took me to see him play. And when he took his first at-bat, I got even more excited about the prospect of being like him. I was amazed by how huge Green was; he towered over everyone else in the stadium. The second pitch of the night, a curveball, sailed right past the centerfield fence for a home run. It was the first time I had ever seen a home run in person, so when my dad asked me what I thought of my favorite player, I was a little nervous. I wanted to say the right thing. I wanted to tell him that Green was great, that he had hit a monster home run, that I loved him. But I couldn\u2019t think of the right words, so I just said, \u201cDad, I think I love Shawn Green.\u201d\n\nThe next day, my dad gave me a pair of Shawn Green rookie cards and a package of baseball stickers. We spent the entire weekend playing card games and collecting stickers. At one point, my dad asked me why I loved Shawn Green so much, and I told him that he was my favorite player because he was big, because he hit a lot of home runs, and because he was good at baseball. When my dad asked me if there was anything else I could think of, I told him that there wasn\u2019t. I told him that I didn\u2019t really care about any of those things. What I cared about was having fun and being with my dad.", "completion_only": "Please write your story in a well structured, coherent manner. Please proofread your content.

I was already excited about the baseball cards my dad had promised me as a gift; I had already decided that I wanted a rookie card of the Dodgers\u2019 starting third baseman, Shawn Green.\n\nI had read several stories about Green in my weekly magazine, including one article that described him as a \u201cyoung all-star\u201d and one that said he\u2019d hit fifty home runs by the time he was twenty-three. I wanted to be like him when I grew up, so my dad took me to see him play. And when he took his first at-bat, I got even more excited about the prospect of being like him. I was amazed by how huge Green was; he towered over everyone else in the stadium. The second pitch of the night, a curveball, sailed right past the centerfield fence for a home run. It was the first time I had ever seen a home run in person, so when my dad asked me what I thought of my favorite player, I was a little nervous. I wanted to say the right thing. I wanted to tell him that Green was great, that he had hit a monster home run, that I loved him. But I couldn\u2019t think of the right words, so I just said, \u201cDad, I think I love Shawn Green.\u201d\n\nThe next day, my dad gave me a pair of Shawn Green rookie cards and a package of baseball stickers. We spent the entire weekend playing card games and collecting stickers. At one point, my dad asked me why I loved Shawn Green so much, and I told him that he was my favorite player because he was big, because he hit a lot of home runs, and because he was good at baseball. When my dad asked me if there was anything else I could think of, I told him that there wasn\u2019t. I told him that I didn\u2019t really care about any of those things. What I cared about was having fun and being with my dad.", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 68, "avg_token_entropy": 1.3991120937392116, "avg_token_perplexity": 6.125987869356172, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

She had been told a lot of times about the importance of handwashing and that she should always keep her hands away from her face. However, as she approached the cinema she saw her mother putting on her mask. This was confusing for her because they had just gotten to the cinema and the signs had clearly said that this was a \u201cCovid-free\u201d cinema.\nAs they entered and the security guard asked the mother to take a ticket for her daughter, the mother refused. The girl had a puzzled look on her face, but the mother knew that if she allowed the girl to enter with her they could both get infected. This would cause the girl to lose her mother. It was the hardest choice she had to make, but she knew that she had to keep her child safe and that that was why she had become a mother. The mother took her daughter into her arms and told her that the theatre had not been able to test every member that was attending, therefore, even if it was called a Covid-free theatre they could still get infected, and so they would watch the movie from the comfort of their home instead.\nThe young girl sat down on the couch and looked at her mother\u2019s face; the mother saw this and smiled and said \u201cdo not be sad baby, I know you love to go out, and I am sorry that you are disappointed but I promise you once this has all blown over we will go out and do everything you love.

She had been told a lot of times about the importance of handwashing and that she should always keep her hands away from her face. However, as she approached the cinema she saw her mother putting on her mask. This was confusing for her because they had just gotten to the cinema and the signs had clearly said that this was a \u201cCovid-free\u201d cinema.\nAs they entered and the security guard asked the mother to take a ticket for her daughter, the mother refused. The girl had a puzzled look on her face, but the mother knew that if she allowed the girl to enter with her they could both get infected. This would cause the girl to lose her mother. It was the hardest choice she had to make, but she knew that she had to keep her child safe and that that was why she had become a mother. The mother took her daughter into her arms and told her that the theatre had not been able to test every member that was attending, therefore, even if it was called a Covid-free theatre they could still get infected, and so they would watch the movie from the comfort of their home instead.\nThe young girl sat down on the couch and looked at her mother\u2019s face; the mother saw this and smiled and said \u201cdo not be sad baby, I know you love to go out, and I am sorry that you are disappointed but I promise you once this has all blown over we will go out and do everything you love. I promise I will not miss anything with you.\u201d The girl smiled and the mother and child watched the movie together from the comfort of their couch.\n\n\nYou have been given an assignment on the subject of \u201cGlobal Warming\u201d\n\nYour assignment is to write a 500-word essay on the topic of \u201cGlobal Warming.\u201d\nYou are expected to discuss the causes and effects of global warming and the steps being taken", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 79, "avg_token_entropy": 1.5474213043451308, "avg_token_perplexity": 7.2257694565766135, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

Lamb wave propagation methods have been successfully applied for damage identification in plate-like structures. However, Lamb wave processing is still a challenging task due to its multimodal and dispersive characteristics. To address this issue, data-driven machine learning approaches as artificial neural network (ANN) have been proposed. However, the effectiveness of ANN can be improved based on its architecture and the learning strategy employed to train it. The present paper proposes a Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm (MPCA) to design an optimum ANN architecture to detect and locate damages in plate-like structures. For the first time in the literature, the MPCA is applied to find damages in plate-like structures. The present work uses one piezoelectric transducer to generate Lamb wave signals on an aluminum plate structure and a linear array of four transducers to capture the scattered signals. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) processes the captured signals to estimate the time-of-flight (ToF) that is the ANN inputs. The ANN output is the damage spatial coordinates. In addition to MPCA optimization, this paper uses a quantitative entropy-based criterion to find the best mother wavelet and the scale values. The presented experimental results show that MPCA is capable of finding a simple ANN architecture with good generalization performance in the proposed damage localization application. The proposed method is compared with the 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). A discussion about the advantages and limitations of the proposed method is presented.\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn safety-critical systems, failure detection and prognostic (FDP) approaches are essential to avoid catastrophic failures. The two main tasks of FDP methods are incipient failure detection and remaining useful life estimation through prognostics techniques [1]. The FDP approaches can be applied in different critical systems as wind turbine [2], gas turbines [3], power systems [4,5], and transmission lines [6].\nStructural health monitoring (SHM) investigates the damage detection and prognostic in structural components of critical systems such as aircraft and bridges. The SHM system provides an online solution for performing in-service structural analysis reducing maintenance costs [7]. The SHM approaches have been developed for mechanical, aerospace, and civil engineering applications [8]. The most important task of the SHM strategy is the damage identification procedure that can be classified into four levels: detection, location, quantification, and prediction [9].\nThe vibration methods compare vibration signatures of damaged and undamaged structures. Usually, a vibration signature is obtained through modal analysis [8]. The electromechanical impedance methods are based on the electromechanical impedance signature [12]. The guided wave methods are based on propagation properties of the acoustic wave as Lamb waves. The Lamb waves are guided waves that propagate in thin-walled structures, and they can propagate long distances with low attenuation and have high sensibility to detect small damages [18,19]. Therefore, Lamb waves have been a promising tool for damage detection and localization in plate-like structures.\nThe SHM methods can be divided into two main approaches: physical-based or data-driven [20]. The physicalbased approaches require a detailed model of the structure while the data-driven approaches are based on database analysis. Phased-array and directional filter [21][22][23], subspace approach [24][25][26], time reversal [27,28], and ellipse-based image [16,29,30] are methodologies based on the physical model of Lamb wave propagation. It is a challenging task due to its multimodal and dispersive characteristics [18,27].\nThe data-driven approaches are machine learning and deep learning [8,31,32]. Machine learning techniques are data-driven approaches that learn patterns found in the database and can be classified into supervised learning and unsupervised learning [27,33]. The most common supervised learning methods are the artificial neural network and support vector machine [33]. Some advantages of these techniques are low computational cost and high generalization capability. Deep learning is a subbranch of machine learning, and it has the capability to deal with a large dataset [20,33]. Recent studies have proposed the 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for structural damage detection and localization [8,10,13,20]. The main advantage of 1D-CNN is automatic feature extraction performed through its initial convolutional layers [10,13,34]. However, CNN has a high computational cost, and its architecture design is a difficult task [35].\nSeveral strategies using ANN for damage localization and classification in plate-like structures have been proposed. Lu et al. [36] implemented an inverse method based on the feedforward artificial neural network for damage identification using PZT transducers. The ANN configuration (the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer) was determined using a rule of thumb. The discrete wavelet transform was applied to signal denoising before feature extraction. Yelve and Mulla [37] proposed damage detection in an aluminum plate using ANN and PZT transducers. The ANN inputs were damage indexes obtained from twelve actuator sensor paths, and the specific software selected the ANN architecture automatically. Feng et al. [30] presented two methods for damage detection in anisotropic wovenfabric carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate using PZT transducers. The first method was a probabilistic approach by constructing a probability matrix, and the second method was an ANN. The ANN inputs were the time-of-flight of the wave acquired by PZT transducers, and a try-and-error method selected the ANN configuration. Hesser et al. [38] proposed an ANN and support vector machine to locate low impact in the aluminum plate. An ANN with one hidden layer was proposed, and the number of neurons was found through a try-and-error method. However, these approaches do not use any method to find an optimized ANN topology. The best choice of neural network topology, weight values, and activation function for a particular application is a difficult task. ANN topology has a high impact on its performance. A small number of neurons may reduce the ANN learning capacity, but an excessive number of neurons may reduce its generalization capacity [39].\nIn this context, the metaheuristic approach formulates the ANN parameter identification task into an optimization problem. The most common method is ANN weight optimization where the metaheuristic algorithm searches for the weight values that minimize a cost function. This approach focuses on the ANN training process where the metaheuristic algorithm provides a way to escape from local minimums, which is the main problem in standard gradient-based methods. Several metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed to improve the ANN training process, such as genetic algorithm [40,41], particle swarm optimization [42], and grasshopper optimization [43]. However, to improve the ANN performance, the cost function needs to balance the weight values, ANN topology, and learning parameters. The genetic algorithm is the common metaheuristic method of ANN architecture optimization [44][45][46][47].\nThe Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm (MPCA) is a metaheuristic that minimizes a mono-objective function providing the simplest neural network topology (lowest number of neurons and faster convergence during the training phase) with the best performance (lowest error) [48]. The MPCA optimization algorithm takes into account all relevant ANN parameters as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, the weight values, the learning rate, the momentum constant, and the activation function [49]. MPCA has been successfully applied to climate prediction applications [39]. The present paper proposes an optimized ANN for damage detection in a plate-like structure using the MPCA. For the first time in the literature, the ANN optimized by MPCA is applied to find damages in plate-like structures. The ANN inputs are the time-of-flight of the Lamb wave reflection captured by four piezoelectric transducers, and the ANN output is the damage localization.\nIn the damage localization methods using ANN, a common approach is to use four PZT transducers placed in the corner of the inspected plate region [30,36,37]. The damage position is estimated using the time-of-flight information. This configuration is similar to a pitch-catch method finding damages in the delimited area by the transducers. In the present paper, a linear array of PZT transducers is investigated. The transducer placement is similar to a phased-array configuration, so the damage location information is strongly related to the time-of-flight and the time delay between adjacent transducers [18]. Using a linear array of transducers is possible to inspect a large area of the plate.\nIn the proposed damage localization method, due to the importance of the ToF estimation, the continuous wavelet transform is implemented to improve the arrival time measurement of the scattered wave from damage. The mother 2 Journal of Sensors wavelet is the main CWT parameter, as it may significantly influence the performance of the transformation. Recent works have proposed wavelet transform for damage detection and localization [4,6,30]. However, these works do not investigate a quantitative approach for mother wavelet selection. The present work uses a quantitative criterion, based on the Shannon entropy calculation, to select the best mother wavelet function [50]. The Shannon entropy criterion selects the most relevant scale values, reducing the CWT calculation. The proposed new method combines two optimization approaches: optimized ANN by MPCA and optimized CWT by entropy criterion. The experimental verification of the proposed method is performed on an aluminum plate structure. A mass of lead is employed to simulate several damage scenarios, providing a database for training the ANN and 1D-CNN. The performance of the proposed method is compared with two 1D-CNN. The first 1D-CNN uses as input the ToF features extracted using CWT, and the second 1D-CNN performs feature extraction directly from raw data acquired from PZT transducers. A discussion about the advantages and limitations of the proposed method is presented.\n\nBackground\n2.1. Continuous Wavelet Transform. Continuous wavelet transform CWT is a linear transformation that decomposes the input signal x\u00f0t\u00de over the scaled and translated versions of the mother wavelet \u03c8\u00f0t\u00de, as shown by the following equation [51]: where s is the scale, \u03c4 is the translation parameter, and \u00f0 * \u00de indicates the complex conjugate of mother wavelet function \u03c8\u00f0t\u00de. Using a proper scale-to-frequency relationship, CWT provides a time-frequency analysis similar to the short-time Fourier transform. However, CWT is more effective in representing nonstationary signals in the time-frequency domain [52,53]. A challenge in using wavelet transform is to establish a criterion to select the mother wavelet. A usual qualitative approach is a method based on a similarity between the mother wavelet and the analyzed signal.\nA suitable quantitative approach is Shannon entropybased optimization. This criterion consists of calculating the normalized Shannon entropy of the CWT coefficients as defined by [50]: where s is the scale vector with M elements, T s is the sample time, and N is the number of samples of the x\u00f0t\u00de signal. Shannon entropy measures the CWT randomness in the timescale domain, where a low entropy value indicates high energy concentration. Therefore, the best mother wavelet has the lowest value of Shannon entropy (Sh).\n\nHilbert\nTransform. The Hilbert transform F Hi \u00f0t\u00de of the real signal x\u00f0t\u00de can be represented by the equation below [54]: The Fourier transform of the F Hi \u00f0t\u00de signal is expressed as where sgn \u00f0\u03c9\u00de is the sign function, X\u00f0\u03c9\u00de is the Fourier transform of input signal x\u00f0t\u00de, and i is the imaginary number. According to Equation (5), the Hilbert transform is a filter in which the amplitudes of spectral components of the input signal x\u00f0t\u00de are left unchanged, but their phases are shifted by 90 degrees (see [54] page 359). This property can be used to calculate the instantaneous amplitude, or envelope, of signal x\u00f0t\u00de.\nThe R\u00f0t\u00de envelope of signal x\u00f0t\u00de is given by [52,54] 2.3. Artificial Neural Networks. Artificial neural networks are computational methods that emulate the human brain learning process. The simple processing units, known as artificial neurons, compose the ANN and are organized through several layers. Typically, the ANN has one input layer, one or more hidden layers, and one output layer. The synaptic weights interconnect the neurons and store the ANN knowledge [39,55]. Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) is a feed-forward model used mainly as a classifier, associative memory, or regression. Figure 1 shows an MLP neural network with just one hidden layer, where Equations (7) and (8) describe the neuron x n of the hidden layer and the neuron y k of the output layer, respectively, being b \u03b1 \u03b2 (\u03b1 = x, y and \u03b2 = n, m) the bias, v nm and \u03c9 kn the weight matrices of the connection between the neuron x n and the neuron z m , and y k with the neuron x n . The neuron 3 Journal of Sensors activation function g 1,2 \u00f0\u00b7\u00de is a nonlinear and smooth function [55]. The frequently used activation functions are sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent.\nANN training is the neuron's weight adjustment process and can be supervised or unsupervised. For an MLP-NN, the gradient-based and stochastic-based approaches are the main supervised training methods [43]. Among gradient-based methods, the frequently used is back-propagation. The back-propagation algorithm calculates the new weights using two steps: forward and backward [39]. In the first step, the input data is applied to the MLP-NN input, starting the data processing. The MLP-NN forward calculations propagate the results layer-by-layer producing the MLP-NN output. The network output y k is subtracted from an expected output of d k to produce an error value [55]: After that, this error is backward propagated from the MLP-NN output to the input. Finally, the neuron weights are adjusted using the delta rule for minimizing the calculated error.\n\nJournal of Sensors\nThe delta rule can be expressed as [55]: where \u0394v nm and \u0394\u03c9 kn are the weight correction factors and \u03b7 is the learning rate parameter. The feed-forward neural networks are popular mainly because of their generalization capability. The generalization refers to the ANN ability to correctly process data that is not part of training data. Therefore, the generalization performance can be estimated by The P data elements are not part of the K data elements-those ones were used to train the ANN [49].\n\n1D Convolutional Neural\nNetworks. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were inspired by the mammalian nervous system. The usual applications of CNN are regression and classification problems [34]. Typically, a CNN is composed of three types of processing layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected neural network (FCN) layers. Figure 2 shows an example of 1D-CNN.\nA convolutional layer extracts relevant features from the input data. Equation (13) describes the convolution operation between layers l and l \u2212 1: where y l k is the output, b l k is the bias of the k th neuron at layer l, s l\u22121 i is the output of the i th neuron at layer l \u2212 1, \u03c9 ik l\u22121 is the kernel from the i th neuron at layer l \u2212 1 to the k th at layer l, and Conv1D\u00f0\u00b7\u00de is the 1D discrete convolution without zero padding [34]. The pooling layer performs a downsampling operation resulting in a dimensional reduction. Pooling    Journal of Sensors   Journal of Sensors could be max-pooling or average pooling. The fully connected layer corresponds to MLP-NN.\n\nOptimal Neural Network Architecture by Multiple\nParticle Collision Algorithm. The identification of the best ANN configuration for a given application and data is a challenging task. One standard procedure is to do several experiments with different ANN configurations for getting acceptable results. The specialist changes the values of ANN parameters for each trial and compares the results with the observed values until finding a set of the most suitable parameters in his judgment [49]. An alternative approach is to formulate the task of identifying the best ANN topology as an optimization problem [56].\nThe goal of optimization problems is finding the suitable hyperparameters of a set that maximizes or minimizes a function, defined as an objective function or cost function. The objective function used in this work is given by [57] f obj = penalty \u00d7 \u03c1 1 \u00d7 E train + \u03c1 2 \u00d7 E gen \u03c1 1 + \u03c1 2 , \u00f014\u00de The first term of Equation (14) is the penalty factor, and the second term is the weighted mean of two errors: train error E train and generalization error E gen . Equation (15) shows the penalty term to evaluate the number of neurons and the epochs to perform the training [49]. The parameter values used in this work are \u03c1 1 = 1, \u03c1 2 = 0:1, C 1 = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , and C 2 = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 .\nThe MPCA optimization strategy must find the ANN configuration that minimizes the objective function (Equation (14)).\nThe ANN parameters taken into account by MPCA are the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, the weight values, the learning rate \u03b7, the momentum constant \u03b1, and the activation function [49].\nThe MPCA is a version of the particle collision algorithm (PCA). The PCA is a stochastic optimization algorithm inspired by the neutron travelling in a nuclear reactor, where two main phenomena can occur: scattering and absorption. The MPCA is a modified version of the particle collision algorithm that uses several particles to explore the search space [48]. Algorithm 1 shows the MPCA pseudocode.\nThe MPCA starts with a random ANN configuration (Old-Config). The Fitness() function calculates Equation (14) that evaluates the ANN configuration performance and updates the Best-Fitness information. For each particle, a stochastic perturbation (function Perturbation()) generates a new ANN configuration (New-Config) closer than the previous one, and the Fitness() function calculates the fitness of it. If New-Config is better than Old-Config, this new configuration is absorbed (the New-Config becomes an Old-Config for the next iterations). The function Exploration() generates small perturbations on closer positions. However, if New-Config is worse than Old-Config, the function Scattering() sends the particle to a different location of the search space trying to escape the local minimum [56]. The blackboard\n\nExperimental Setup and Results\nThe validation scenario of the proposed damage detection method is an aluminum plate (500 mm \u00d7 500 mm \u00d7 1 mm) with four PZT transducers bounded on its surface, as represented by Figure 3. These transducers, which have a 20 mm diameter, are arranged with a space of 5 mm and labeled as R0, R1, R2, and T0. Figure 3 shows twelve square sectors (50 mm sides) that delimit the damage scan region. The Lamb wave excitation signal is produced by transducer T0 and received by the other four transducers (R0, R1, R2, and R3). Figure 4 shows the experiment setup. The DE1-SoC (System-on-Chip) Development board has a hardware design platform which combines the dual-core Cortex-A9 embedded cores with FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). This board is programmed to generate a Gaussian window five cycles sine tone burst through a look-up table implemented in programmable logic and using a DAC (10 bits) converter. The DAC signal is amplified by the power circuit; then, the output signal generates the Lamb waves through the PZT transducer T0. The sine signal is generated with three different frequencies: 12 kHz, 16 kHz, and 20 kHz. The Lamb waves propagate through the aluminum board, and they are captured by the PZT transducers R0, R1, R2, and R3. The 12-bit ADC converts the analog voltage from the PZT transducers into digital signals. The sampling rate is set to 400 kHz.\nTwo signals received by sensor R0 are plotted in Figure 5(a). The first signal (black color) corresponds to the undamaged condition, and the second signal (red color) represents the signal received when damage occurs on sector S5. The excitation arrow indicates the direct wave received from the T0 transducer, and the damage arrow indicates the reflected wave by the damage, as shown in Figure 5(a). Figure 5(b) shows the difference signal, corresponding to the damage signal subtracted from the undamaged signal.\nIn the next step, the continuous wavelet transform of the difference signal is performed using six different mother wavelets. Figure 6 presents the normalized Shannon entropy of the CWT coefficients. The selected mother wavelet is the mexh (Mexican hat) which has the minimum entropy.\nThe resultant scalogram is plotted in Figure 7(b). The CWT minimum entropy signal, shown in Figure 7(c), is constructed from the scalogram by getting the CWT coefficients which scale has the minimum entropy value. The Hilbert transform of the CWT minimum entropy signal makes it possible to obtain the peak position as presented in Figure 7(c). Table 1 shows the ANN inputs. The peak position of the minimum entropy CWT coefficient obtained for each sensor R0, R1, R2, and R3 is the ANN inputs. The ANN output is the damage coordinate (x, y).\nA mass of lead is employed to simulate damage in the aluminum plate. The training and validation databases are generated by placing the mass of lead in the center of each sector defined in Figure 3. A total of 3600 samples, 300 samples by sector, is used to train the networks. The total number of samples is randomly divided into three sets: 2520 samples are selected for training, 540 samples for validation, and 540 samples for generalization. The training set is used to update the ANN weights and biases. The validation set evaluates the ANN generalization performance during the training phase (cross-validation process). A poor generalization performance is signaled by the raising of the validation error [56]. The generalization set is used to evaluate the ANN generalization performance after the training process. Table 2 presents the ANN parameters found by the MPCA optimization algorithm. The parameters used in the MPCA are 10 particles using a multiprocessing machine (one particle per processor) and 30 iterations (a scheme used to explore a better solution around the new particle location), and the stopping criterion is the maximum of 300 objective function evaluations.\nThe MPCA-ANN results are compared with two 1D-CNN. The 1D-CNN-CWT uses the same dataset applied to MPCA-ANN. This dataset corresponds to the features extracted using the CWT as defined in Table 1. The 1D-CNN-RAW uses the raw signals acquired by the PZT sensors. The mean square    Table 3 shows the 1D-CNN-CWT architecture.\nFor 1D-CNN-RAW, the training parameters are batch size of 32, learning rate of 1e \u2212 4, and 200 epochs. Table 4 shows the 1D-CNN-RAW architecture. Table 5 shows the dataset division by sector. The damage is simulated placing the mass in the center of the sector indicated by the first column of Table 5. The second column of Table 5 presents the damage location represented by Cartesian's coordinates which origin is the corner of sector S12. The last three columns of Table 5 present the rootmean-square error (RMSE) of the estimated damage position by MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT, and 1D-CNN-RAW, respectively. Equation (16) calculates the RMSE of the damage positions, where \u00f0x ann \u00f0n\u00de, y ann \u00f0n\u00de\u00de is the damage position estimated by ANN and \u00f0x\u00f0n\u00de, y\u00f0n\u00de\u00de is the real damage position: Figure 8 shows the MPCA-ANN performance. The real damage position (the mass position in the aluminum board) is represented by blue color, and the estimated damage position by ANN is represented by red color.\nIn order to evaluate the MPCA-ANN generalization capability, experiments were performed with mass placed in the vertices of sectors S6 and S7. The second column of Table 6 presents each vertex location represented by Cartesian's coordinates which origin is the corner of sector S12. 200 experiments were performed for each vertex. The last three columns of Table 6 present the RMSE of the estimated damage position by MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT, and 1D-CNN-RAW, respectively. Figure 9 shows the damage position estimated by MPCA-ANN for each case of Table 6. Each plot of Figure 9 represents the physical aluminum board; the red points show the estimated damage position and the blue cross the real damage position.\n\nDiscussion\nThe minimum Shannon entropy selected the Mexican hat as the best choice for the mother wavelet as shown by Figure 6. The CWT performance can be visualized by Figures 7(b) and 7(c). The results presented by these figures indicate that the CWT can be evaluated only on the scale with minimum entropy value, where more energy concentration exists. The comparison between Figures 7(a) and 7(b) shows that the CWT using the Mexican hat as the mother wavelet, calculated in the scale with minimum entropy, can estimate the peak position of the Lamb wave reflection signal.\nThe MPCA algorithm found the ANN architecture shown in Table 2. The ANN training performance result, presented in Figure 8, indicates that the ANN can find the correct damage    Table 5 shows the training results for the MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT. and 1D-CNN-RAW. The ANN-MPCA presented a good performance in comparison with the two versions of 1D-CNN. The results of Table 6 show the good generalization capability of MPCA-ANN when compared with the 1D-CNN-CWT and 1D-CNN-RAW.\nA metric termed mean normalized distance (MND) [13] is used to compare the global result of the generalization performance. The distance values are normalized with length of the inspected board region. Equation (17) describes the MND metric: ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi x n ann n \u00f0 \u00de \u2212 x n n \u00f0 \u00de \u00f0 \u00de 2 + y n ann n \u00f0 \u00de \u2212 y n n \u00f0 \u00de \u00f0 where \u00f0x n ann , y n ann \u00de is the normalized damage position found by ANN, \u00f0x n , y n \u00de is the real normalized position of damage, and N is the number of samples. The normalized coordinate x n corresponds to the division of x by 200 mm (length of inspected area), and the normalized coordinate y n corresponds to the division of y by 150 mm (length of inspected area). Table 7 shows MND values for the three algorithms, with errors of order O\u00f010 \u22121 \u00de, and the best performance was the 1D-CNN-RAW.\nThe MND results presented in Table 7 show that 1D-CNN-RAW with features extracted directly from raw data presents the same generalization performance in comparison with the 1D-CNN-CWT. This result shows the good damage localization information contained in ToF features extracted using the CWT optimized by entropy calculation. Normally, the CWT performs several convolutional operations using different scale values. The CWT operation has high computational cost. However, the entropy method limits the CWT just to optimum scale value reducing the computational cost of the CWT operation. Therefore, the 1D-CNN-CWT has the same performance as 1D-CNN-RAW but with a low computational cost. The 1D-CNN-RAW uses two convolutional layers, while 1D-CNN-CWT uses just one convolutional layer. Table 8 shows an estimated computational cost comparison between MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT, and 1D-CNN-RAW. The computational cost is indirectly estimated by the number of convolutions, the number of neurons, and the number of weights.\nBoth 1D-CNN methods presented a better generalization performance in comparison with MPCA-ANN. This result confirms the great 1D-CNN capability to extract relevant features from input data. However, the 1D-CNN structure has a high computational cost. The 1D-CNN-CWT architecture, presented in Table 3, has two fully connected layers with 60 neurons, while the 1D-CNN-RAW architecture, presented in Table 4, has one fully connected layer with 60 neurons. The generalization performance of MPCA-ANN with only one hidden layer and five neurons was close to the complex 1D-CNN structures. An estimated computational cost is presented in Table 8. The lowest computational effort is linked to the MPCA-ANN, due to the design based on searching the simplest neural architecture. Such low neural network complexity shows the adequacy for embedded applications, with limited computational capacity, or to be implemented in a hardware processing device, maintaining a good generalization capability.\n\nConclusion\nIn this paper, an optimized artificial neural network is proposed to locate damages into plate-like structures. The Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm finds the most adequate ANN architecture for the considered dataset. The experimental results of damage detection and localization in an aluminum plate validate the effectiveness of MPCA in finding a simple and optimized ANN architecture with good generalization capability. The generalization performance of MPCA-ANN was compared with two 1D-CNN. The results  show that MPCA-ANN has a good performance in comparison with complex 1D-CNN structures. The continuous wavelet transform processes the Lamb wave reflections and improves the time-of-flight estimation. The Shannon entropy-based criterion finds the best mother wavelet and scale values for detecting the Lamb wave reflections. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimized CWT. In future works, this method will be extended to more complex plate-like structures such as composite structures.\n\nData Availability\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.", "prompt": "A Damage Detection Method Using Neural Network Optimized by Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm\n\nA critical task of structural health monitoring is damage detection and localization. Lamb wave propagation methods have been successfully applied for damage identification in plate-like structures. However, Lamb wave processing is still a challenging task due to its multimodal and dispersive characteristics. To address this issue, data-driven machine learning approaches as artificial neural network (ANN) have been proposed. However, the effectiveness of ANN can be improved based on its architecture and the learning strategy employed to train it. The present paper proposes a Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm (MPCA) to design an optimum ANN architecture to detect and locate damages in plate-like structures. For the first time in the literature, the MPCA is applied to find damages in plate-like structures. The present work uses one piezoelectric transducer to generate Lamb wave signals on an aluminum plate structure and a linear array of four transducers to capture the scattered signals. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) processes the captured signals to estimate the time-of-flight (ToF) that is the ANN inputs. The ANN output is the damage spatial coordinates. In addition to MPCA optimization, this paper uses a quantitative entropy-based criterion to find the best mother wavelet and the scale values. The presented experimental results show that MPCA is capable of finding a simple ANN architecture with good generalization performance in the proposed damage localization application. The proposed method is compared with the 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). A discussion about the advantages and limitations of the proposed method is presented.\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn safety-critical systems, failure detection and prognostic (FDP) approaches are essential to avoid catastrophic failures. The two main tasks of FDP methods are incipient failure detection and remaining useful life estimation through prognostics techniques [1]. The FDP approaches can be applied in different critical systems as wind turbine [2], gas turbines [3], power systems [4,5], and transmission lines [6].\nStructural health monitoring (SHM) investigates the damage detection and prognostic in structural components of critical systems such as aircraft and bridges. The SHM system provides an online solution for performing in-service structural analysis reducing maintenance costs [7]. The SHM approaches have been developed for mechanical, aerospace, and civil engineering applications [8]. The most important task of the SHM strategy is the damage identification procedure that can be classified into four levels: detection, location, quantification, and prediction [9].\nThe vibration methods compare vibration signatures of damaged and undamaged structures. Usually, a vibration signature is obtained through modal analysis [8]. The electromechanical impedance methods are based on the electromechanical impedance signature [12]. The guided wave methods are based on propagation properties of the acoustic wave as Lamb waves. The Lamb waves are guided waves that propagate in thin-walled structures, and they can propagate long distances with low attenuation and have high sensibility to detect small damages [18,19]. Therefore, Lamb waves have been a promising tool for damage detection and localization in plate-like structures.\nThe SHM methods can be divided into two main approaches: physical-based or data-driven [20]. The physicalbased approaches require a detailed model of the structure while the data-driven approaches are based on database analysis. Phased-array and directional filter [21][22][23], subspace approach [24][25][26], time reversal [27,28], and ellipse-based image [16,29,30] are methodologies based on the physical model of Lamb wave propagation. It is a challenging task due to its multimodal and dispersive characteristics [18,27].\nThe data-driven approaches are machine learning and deep learning [8,31,32]. Machine learning techniques are data-driven approaches that learn patterns found in the database and can be classified into supervised learning and unsupervised learning [27,33]. The most common supervised learning methods are the artificial neural network and support vector machine [33]. Some advantages of these techniques are low computational cost and high generalization capability. Deep learning is a subbranch of machine learning, and it has the capability to deal with a large dataset [20,33]. Recent studies have proposed the 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for structural damage detection and localization [8,10,13,20]. The main advantage of 1D-CNN is automatic feature extraction performed through its initial convolutional layers [10,13,34]. However, CNN has a high computational cost, and its architecture design is a difficult task [35].\nSeveral strategies using ANN for damage localization and classification in plate-like structures have been proposed. Lu et al. [36] implemented an inverse method based on the feedforward artificial neural network for damage identification using PZT transducers. The ANN configuration (the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer) was determined using a rule of thumb. The discrete wavelet transform was applied to signal denoising before feature extraction. Yelve and Mulla [37] proposed damage detection in an aluminum plate using ANN and PZT transducers. The ANN inputs were damage indexes obtained from twelve actuator sensor paths, and the specific software selected the ANN architecture automatically. Feng et al. [30] presented two methods for damage detection in anisotropic wovenfabric carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate using PZT transducers. The first method was a probabilistic approach by constructing a probability matrix, and the second method was an ANN. The ANN inputs were the time-of-flight of the wave acquired by PZT transducers, and a try-and-error method selected the ANN configuration. Hesser et al. [38] proposed an ANN and support vector machine to locate low impact in the aluminum plate. An ANN with one hidden layer was proposed, and the number of neurons was found through a try-and-error method. However, these approaches do not use any method to find an optimized ANN topology. The best choice of neural network topology, weight values, and activation function for a particular application is a difficult task. ANN topology has a high impact on its performance. A small number of neurons may reduce the ANN learning capacity, but an excessive number of neurons may reduce its generalization capacity [39].\nIn this context, the metaheuristic approach formulates the ANN parameter identification task into an optimization problem. The most common method is ANN weight optimization where the metaheuristic algorithm searches for the weight values that minimize a cost function. This approach focuses on the ANN training process where the metaheuristic algorithm provides a way to escape from local minimums, which is the main problem in standard gradient-based methods. Several metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed to improve the ANN training process, such as genetic algorithm [40,41], particle swarm optimization [42], and grasshopper optimization [43]. However, to improve the ANN performance, the cost function needs to balance the weight values, ANN topology, and learning parameters. The genetic algorithm is the common metaheuristic method of ANN architecture optimization [44][45][46][47].\nThe Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm (MPCA) is a metaheuristic that minimizes a mono-objective function providing the simplest neural network topology (lowest number of neurons and faster convergence during the training phase) with the best performance (lowest error) [48]. The MPCA optimization algorithm takes into account all relevant ANN parameters as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, the weight values, the learning rate, the momentum constant, and the activation function [49]. MPCA has been successfully applied to climate prediction applications [39]. The present paper proposes an optimized ANN for damage detection in a plate-like structure using the MPCA. For the first time in the literature, the ANN optimized by MPCA is applied to find damages in plate-like structures. The ANN inputs are the time-of-flight of the Lamb wave reflection captured by four piezoelectric transducers, and the ANN output is the damage localization.\nIn the damage localization methods using ANN, a common approach is to use four PZT transducers placed in the corner of the inspected plate region [30,36,37]. The damage position is estimated using the time-of-flight information. This configuration is similar to a pitch-catch method finding damages in the delimited area by the transducers. In the present paper, a linear array of PZT transducers is investigated. The transducer placement is similar to a phased-array configuration, so the damage location information is strongly related to the time-of-flight and the time delay between adjacent transducers [18]. Using a linear array of transducers is possible to inspect a large area of the plate.\nIn the proposed damage localization method, due to the importance of the ToF estimation, the continuous wavelet transform is implemented to improve the arrival time measurement of the scattered wave from damage. The mother 2 Journal of Sensors wavelet is the main CWT parameter, as it may significantly influence the performance of the transformation. Recent works have proposed wavelet transform for damage detection and localization [4,6,30]. However, these works do not investigate a quantitative approach for mother wavelet selection. The present work uses a quantitative criterion, based on the Shannon entropy calculation, to select the best mother wavelet function [50]. The Shannon entropy criterion selects the most relevant scale values, reducing the CWT calculation. The proposed new method combines two optimization approaches: optimized ANN by MPCA and optimized CWT by entropy criterion. The experimental verification of the proposed method is performed on an aluminum plate structure. A mass of lead is employed to simulate several damage scenarios, providing a database for training the ANN and 1D-CNN. The performance of the proposed method is compared with two 1D-CNN. The first 1D-CNN uses as input the ToF features extracted using CWT, and the second 1D-CNN performs feature extraction directly from raw data acquired from PZT transducers. A discussion about the advantages and limitations of the proposed method is presented.\n\nBackground\n2.1. Continuous Wavelet Transform. Continuous wavelet transform CWT is a linear transformation that decomposes the input signal x\u00f0t\u00de over the scaled and translated versions of the mother wavelet \u03c8\u00f0t\u00de, as shown by the following equation [51]: where s is the scale, \u03c4 is the translation parameter, and \u00f0 * \u00de indicates the complex conjugate of mother wavelet function \u03c8\u00f0t\u00de. Using a proper scale-to-frequency relationship, CWT provides a time-frequency analysis similar to the short-time Fourier transform. However, CWT is more effective in representing nonstationary signals in the time-frequency domain [52,53]. A challenge in using wavelet transform is to establish a criterion to select the mother wavelet. A usual qualitative approach is a method based on a similarity between the mother wavelet and the analyzed signal.\nA suitable quantitative approach is Shannon entropybased optimization. This criterion consists of calculating the normalized Shannon entropy of the CWT coefficients as defined by [50]: where s is the scale vector with M elements, T s is the sample time, and N is the number of samples of the x\u00f0t\u00de signal. Shannon entropy measures the CWT randomness in the timescale domain, where a low entropy value indicates high energy concentration. Therefore, the best mother wavelet has the lowest value of Shannon entropy (Sh).\n\nHilbert\nTransform. The Hilbert transform F Hi \u00f0t\u00de of the real signal x\u00f0t\u00de can be represented by the equation below [54]: The Fourier transform of the F Hi \u00f0t\u00de signal is expressed as where sgn \u00f0\u03c9\u00de is the sign function, X\u00f0\u03c9\u00de is the Fourier transform of input signal x\u00f0t\u00de, and i is the imaginary number. According to Equation (5), the Hilbert transform is a filter in which the amplitudes of spectral components of the input signal x\u00f0t\u00de are left unchanged, but their phases are shifted by 90 degrees (see [54] page 359). This property can be used to calculate the instantaneous amplitude, or envelope, of signal x\u00f0t\u00de.\nThe R\u00f0t\u00de envelope of signal x\u00f0t\u00de is given by [52,54] 2.3. Artificial Neural Networks. Artificial neural networks are computational methods that emulate the human brain learning process. The simple processing units, known as artificial neurons, compose the ANN and are organized through several layers. Typically, the ANN has one input layer, one or more hidden layers, and one output layer. The synaptic weights interconnect the neurons and store the ANN knowledge [39,55]. Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) is a feed-forward model used mainly as a classifier, associative memory, or regression. Figure 1 shows an MLP neural network with just one hidden layer, where Equations (7) and (8) describe the neuron x n of the hidden layer and the neuron y k of the output layer, respectively, being b \u03b1 \u03b2 (\u03b1 = x, y and \u03b2 = n, m) the bias, v nm and \u03c9 kn the weight matrices of the connection between the neuron x n and the neuron z m , and y k with the neuron x n . The neuron 3 Journal of Sensors activation function g 1,2 \u00f0\u00b7\u00de is a nonlinear and smooth function [55]. The frequently used activation functions are sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent.\nANN training is the neuron's weight adjustment process and can be supervised or unsupervised. For an MLP-NN, the gradient-based and stochastic-based approaches are the main supervised training methods [43]. Among gradient-based methods, the frequently used is back-propagation. The back-propagation algorithm calculates the new weights using two steps: forward and backward [39]. In the first step, the input data is applied to the MLP-NN input, starting the data processing. The MLP-NN forward calculations propagate the results layer-by-layer producing the MLP-NN output. The network output y k is subtracted from an expected output of d k to produce an error value [55]: After that, this error is backward propagated from the MLP-NN output to the input. Finally, the neuron weights are adjusted using the delta rule for minimizing the calculated error.\n\nJournal of Sensors\nThe delta rule can be expressed as [55]: where \u0394v nm and \u0394\u03c9 kn are the weight correction factors and \u03b7 is the learning rate parameter. The feed-forward neural networks are popular mainly because of their generalization capability. The generalization refers to the ANN ability to correctly process data that is not part of training data. Therefore, the generalization performance can be estimated by The P data elements are not part of the K data elements-those ones were used to train the ANN [49].\n\n1D Convolutional Neural\nNetworks. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were inspired by the mammalian nervous system. The usual applications of CNN are regression and classification problems [34]. Typically, a CNN is composed of three types of processing layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected neural network (FCN) layers. Figure 2 shows an example of 1D-CNN.\nA convolutional layer extracts relevant features from the input data. Equation (13) describes the convolution operation between layers l and l \u2212 1: where y l k is the output, b l k is the bias of the k th neuron at layer l, s l\u22121 i is the output of the i th neuron at layer l \u2212 1, \u03c9 ik l\u22121 is the kernel from the i th neuron at layer l \u2212 1 to the k th at layer l, and Conv1D\u00f0\u00b7\u00de is the 1D discrete convolution without zero padding [34].

The identification of the best ANN configuration for a given application and data is a challenging task. One standard procedure is to do several experiments with different ANN configurations for getting acceptable results. The specialist changes the values of ANN parameters for each trial and compares the results with the observed values until finding a set of the most suitable parameters in his judgment [49]. An alternative approach is to formulate the task of identifying the best ANN topology as an optimization problem [56].\nThe goal of optimization problems is finding the suitable hyperparameters of a set that maximizes or minimizes a function, defined as an objective function or cost function. The objective function used in this work is given by [57] f obj = penalty \u00d7 \u03c1 1 \u00d7 E train + \u03c1 2 \u00d7 E gen \u03c1 1 + \u03c1 2 , \u00f014\u00de The first term of Equation (14) is the penalty factor, and the second term is the weighted mean of two errors: train error E train and generalization error E gen . Equation (15) shows the penalty term to evaluate the number of neurons and the epochs to perform the training [49]. The parameter values used in this work are \u03c1 1 = 1, \u03c1 2 = 0:1, C 1 = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , and C 2 = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 .\nThe MPCA optimization strategy must find the ANN configuration that minimizes the objective function (Equation (14)).\nThe ANN parameters taken into account by MPCA are the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, the weight values, the learning rate \u03b7, the momentum constant \u03b1, and the activation function [49].\nThe MPCA is a version of the particle collision algorithm (PCA). The PCA is a stochastic optimization algorithm inspired by the neutron travelling in a nuclear reactor, where two main phenomena can occur: scattering and absorption. The MPCA is a modified version of the particle collision algorithm that uses several particles to explore the search space [48]. Algorithm 1 shows the MPCA pseudocode.\nThe MPCA starts with a random ANN configuration (Old-Config). The Fitness() function calculates Equation (14) that evaluates the ANN configuration performance and updates the Best-Fitness information. For each particle, a stochastic perturbation (function Perturbation()) generates a new ANN configuration (New-Config) closer than the previous one, and the Fitness() function calculates the fitness of it. If New-Config is better than Old-Config, this new configuration is absorbed (the New-Config becomes an Old-Config for the next iterations). The function Exploration() generates small perturbations on closer positions. However, if New-Config is worse than Old-Config, the function Scattering() sends the particle to a different location of the search space trying to escape the local minimum [56]. The blackboard\n\nExperimental Setup and Results\nThe validation scenario of the proposed damage detection method is an aluminum plate (500 mm \u00d7 500 mm \u00d7 1 mm) with four PZT transducers bounded on its surface, as represented by Figure 3. These transducers, which have a 20 mm diameter, are arranged with a space of 5 mm and labeled as R0, R1, R2, and T0. Figure 3 shows twelve square sectors (50 mm sides) that delimit the damage scan region. The Lamb wave excitation signal is produced by transducer T0 and received by the other four transducers (R0, R1, R2, and R3). Figure 4 shows the experiment setup. The DE1-SoC (System-on-Chip) Development board has a hardware design platform which combines the dual-core Cortex-A9 embedded cores with FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). This board is programmed to generate a Gaussian window five cycles sine tone burst through a look-up table implemented in programmable logic and using a DAC (10 bits) converter. The DAC signal is amplified by the power circuit; then, the output signal generates the Lamb waves through the PZT transducer T0. The sine signal is generated with three different frequencies: 12 kHz, 16 kHz, and 20 kHz. The Lamb waves propagate through the aluminum board, and they are captured by the PZT transducers R0, R1, R2, and R3. The 12-bit ADC converts the analog voltage from the PZT transducers into digital signals. The sampling rate is set to 400 kHz.\nTwo signals received by sensor R0 are plotted in Figure 5(a). The first signal (black color) corresponds to the undamaged condition, and the second signal (red color) represents the signal received when damage occurs on sector S5. The excitation arrow indicates the direct wave received from the T0 transducer, and the damage arrow indicates the reflected wave by the damage, as shown in Figure 5(a). Figure 5(b) shows the difference signal, corresponding to the damage signal subtracted from the undamaged signal.\nIn the next step, the continuous wavelet transform of the difference signal is performed using six different mother wavelets. Figure 6 presents the normalized Shannon entropy of the CWT coefficients. The selected mother wavelet is the mexh (Mexican hat) which has the minimum entropy.\nThe resultant scalogram is plotted in Figure 7(b). The CWT minimum entropy signal, shown in Figure 7(c), is constructed from the scalogram by getting the CWT coefficients which scale has the minimum entropy value. The Hilbert transform of the CWT minimum entropy signal makes it possible to obtain the peak position as presented in Figure 7(c). Table 1 shows the ANN inputs. The peak position of the minimum entropy CWT coefficient obtained for each sensor R0, R1, R2, and R3 is the ANN inputs. The ANN output is the damage coordinate (x, y).\nA mass of lead is employed to simulate damage in the aluminum plate. The training and validation databases are generated by placing the mass of lead in the center of each sector defined in Figure 3. A total of 3600 samples, 300 samples by sector, is used to train the networks. The total number of samples is randomly divided into three sets: 2520 samples are selected for training, 540 samples for validation, and 540 samples for generalization. The training set is used to update the ANN weights and biases. The validation set evaluates the ANN generalization performance during the training phase (cross-validation process). A poor generalization performance is signaled by the raising of the validation error [56]. The generalization set is used to evaluate the ANN generalization performance after the training process. Table 2 presents the ANN parameters found by the MPCA optimization algorithm. The parameters used in the MPCA are 10 particles using a multiprocessing machine (one particle per processor) and 30 iterations (a scheme used to explore a better solution around the new particle location), and the stopping criterion is the maximum of 300 objective function evaluations.\nThe MPCA-ANN results are compared with two 1D-CNN. The 1D-CNN-CWT uses the same dataset applied to MPCA-ANN. This dataset corresponds to the features extracted using the CWT as defined in Table 1. The 1D-CNN-RAW uses the raw signals acquired by the PZT sensors. The mean square    Table 3 shows the 1D-CNN-CWT architecture.\nFor 1D-CNN-RAW, the training parameters are batch size of 32, learning rate of 1e \u2212 4, and 200 epochs. Table 4 shows the 1D-CNN-RAW architecture. Table 5 shows the dataset division by sector. The damage is simulated placing the mass in the center of the sector indicated by the first column of Table 5. The second column of Table 5 presents the damage location represented by Cartesian's coordinates which origin is the corner of sector S12. The last three columns of Table 5 present the rootmean-square error (RMSE) of the estimated damage position by MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT, and 1D-CNN-RAW, respectively. Equation (16) calculates the RMSE of the damage positions, where \u00f0x ann \u00f0n\u00de, y ann \u00f0n\u00de\u00de is the damage position estimated by ANN and \u00f0x\u00f0n\u00de, y\u00f0n\u00de\u00de is the real damage position: Figure 8 shows the MPCA-ANN performance. The real damage position (the mass position in the aluminum board) is represented by blue color, and the estimated damage position by ANN is represented by red color.\nIn order to evaluate the MPCA-ANN generalization capability, experiments were performed with mass placed in the vertices of sectors S6 and S7. The second column of Table 6 presents each vertex location represented by Cartesian's coordinates which origin is the corner of sector S12. 200 experiments were performed for each vertex. The last three columns of Table 6 present the RMSE of the estimated damage position by MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT, and 1D-CNN-RAW, respectively. Figure 9 shows the damage position estimated by MPCA-ANN for each case of Table 6. Each plot of Figure 9 represents the physical aluminum board; the red points show the estimated damage position and the blue cross the real damage position.\n\nDiscussion\nThe minimum Shannon entropy selected the Mexican hat as the best choice for the mother wavelet as shown by Figure 6. The CWT performance can be visualized by Figures 7(b) and 7(c). The results presented by these figures indicate that the CWT can be evaluated only on the scale with minimum entropy value, where more energy concentration exists. The comparison between Figures 7(a) and 7(b) shows that the CWT using the Mexican hat as the mother wavelet, calculated in the scale with minimum entropy, can estimate the peak position of the Lamb wave reflection signal.\nThe MPCA algorithm found the ANN architecture shown in Table 2. The ANN training performance result, presented in Figure 8, indicates that the ANN can find the correct damage    Table 5 shows the training results for the MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT. and 1D-CNN-RAW. The ANN-MPCA presented a good performance in comparison with the two versions of 1D-CNN. The results of Table 6 show the good generalization capability of MPCA-ANN when compared with the 1D-CNN-CWT and 1D-CNN-RAW.\nA metric termed mean normalized distance (MND) [13] is used to compare the global result of the generalization performance. The distance values are normalized with length of the inspected board region. Equation (17) describes the MND metric: ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi x n ann n \u00f0 \u00de \u2212 x n n \u00f0 \u00de \u00f0 \u00de 2 + y n ann n \u00f0 \u00de \u2212 y n n \u00f0 \u00de \u00f0 where \u00f0x n ann , y n ann \u00de is the normalized damage position found by ANN, \u00f0x n , y n \u00de is the real normalized position of damage, and N is the number of samples. The normalized coordinate x n corresponds to the division of x by 200 mm (length of inspected area), and the normalized coordinate y n corresponds to the division of y by 150 mm (length of inspected area). Table 7 shows MND values for the three algorithms, with errors of order O\u00f010 \u22121 \u00de, and the best performance was the 1D-CNN-RAW.\nThe MND results presented in Table 7 show that 1D-CNN-RAW with features extracted directly from raw data presents the same generalization performance in comparison with the 1D-CNN-CWT. This result shows the good damage localization information contained in ToF features extracted using the CWT optimized by entropy calculation. Normally, the CWT performs several convolutional operations using different scale values. The CWT operation has high computational cost. However, the entropy method limits the CWT just to optimum scale value reducing the computational cost of the CWT operation. Therefore, the 1D-CNN-CWT has the same performance as 1D-CNN-RAW but with a low computational cost. The 1D-CNN-RAW uses two convolutional layers, while 1D-CNN-CWT uses just one convolutional layer. Table 8 shows an estimated computational cost comparison between MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT, and 1D-CNN-RAW. The computational cost is indirectly estimated by the number of convolutions, the number of neurons, and the number of weights.\nBoth 1D-CNN methods presented a better generalization performance in comparison with MPCA-ANN. This result confirms the great 1D-CNN capability to extract relevant features from input data. However, the 1D-CNN structure has a high computational cost. The 1D-CNN-CWT architecture, presented in Table 3, has two fully connected layers with 60 neurons, while the 1D-CNN-RAW architecture, presented in Table 4, has one fully connected layer with 60 neurons. The generalization performance of MPCA-ANN with only one hidden layer and five neurons was close to the complex 1D-CNN structures. An estimated computational cost is presented in Table 8. The lowest computational effort is linked to the MPCA-ANN, due to the design based on searching the simplest neural architecture. Such low neural network complexity shows the adequacy for embedded applications, with limited computational capacity, or to be implemented in a hardware processing device, maintaining a good generalization capability.\n\nConclusion\nIn this paper, an optimized artificial neural network is proposed to locate damages into plate-like structures. The Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm finds the most adequate ANN architecture for the considered dataset. The experimental results of damage detection and localization in an aluminum plate validate the effectiveness of MPCA in finding a simple and optimized ANN architecture with good generalization capability. The generalization performance of MPCA-ANN was compared with two 1D-CNN. The results  show that MPCA-ANN has a good performance in comparison with complex 1D-CNN structures. The continuous wavelet transform processes the Lamb wave reflections and improves the time-of-flight estimation. The Shannon entropy-based criterion finds the best mother wavelet and scale values for detecting the Lamb wave reflections. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimized CWT. In future works, this method will be extended to more complex plate-like structures such as composite structures.\n\nData Availability\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.\nWrite a 500-word creative story:", "original_prompt": "Write a 500-word creative story:", "full_output": "A Damage Detection Method Using Neural Network Optimized by Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm\n\nA critical task of structural health monitoring is damage detection and localization. Lamb wave propagation methods have been successfully applied for damage identification in plate-like structures. However, Lamb wave processing is still a challenging task due to its multimodal and dispersive characteristics. To address this issue, data-driven machine learning approaches as artificial neural network (ANN) have been proposed. However, the effectiveness of ANN can be improved based on its architecture and the learning strategy employed to train it. The present paper proposes a Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm (MPCA) to design an optimum ANN architecture to detect and locate damages in plate-like structures. For the first time in the literature, the MPCA is applied to find damages in plate-like structures. The present work uses one piezoelectric transducer to generate Lamb wave signals on an aluminum plate structure and a linear array of four transducers to capture the scattered signals. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) processes the captured signals to estimate the time-of-flight (ToF) that is the ANN inputs. The ANN output is the damage spatial coordinates. In addition to MPCA optimization, this paper uses a quantitative entropy-based criterion to find the best mother wavelet and the scale values. The presented experimental results show that MPCA is capable of finding a simple ANN architecture with good generalization performance in the proposed damage localization application. The proposed method is compared with the 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). A discussion about the advantages and limitations of the proposed method is presented.\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn safety-critical systems, failure detection and prognostic (FDP) approaches are essential to avoid catastrophic failures. The two main tasks of FDP methods are incipient failure detection and remaining useful life estimation through prognostics techniques [1]. The FDP approaches can be applied in different critical systems as wind turbine [2], gas turbines [3], power systems [4,5], and transmission lines [6].\nStructural health monitoring (SHM) investigates the damage detection and prognostic in structural components of critical systems such as aircraft and bridges. The SHM system provides an online solution for performing in-service structural analysis reducing maintenance costs [7]. The SHM approaches have been developed for mechanical, aerospace, and civil engineering applications [8]. The most important task of the SHM strategy is the damage identification procedure that can be classified into four levels: detection, location, quantification, and prediction [9].\nThe vibration methods compare vibration signatures of damaged and undamaged structures. Usually, a vibration signature is obtained through modal analysis [8]. The electromechanical impedance methods are based on the electromechanical impedance signature [12]. The guided wave methods are based on propagation properties of the acoustic wave as Lamb waves. The Lamb waves are guided waves that propagate in thin-walled structures, and they can propagate long distances with low attenuation and have high sensibility to detect small damages [18,19]. Therefore, Lamb waves have been a promising tool for damage detection and localization in plate-like structures.\nThe SHM methods can be divided into two main approaches: physical-based or data-driven [20]. The physicalbased approaches require a detailed model of the structure while the data-driven approaches are based on database analysis. Phased-array and directional filter [21][22][23], subspace approach [24][25][26], time reversal [27,28], and ellipse-based image [16,29,30] are methodologies based on the physical model of Lamb wave propagation. It is a challenging task due to its multimodal and dispersive characteristics [18,27].\nThe data-driven approaches are machine learning and deep learning [8,31,32]. Machine learning techniques are data-driven approaches that learn patterns found in the database and can be classified into supervised learning and unsupervised learning [27,33]. The most common supervised learning methods are the artificial neural network and support vector machine [33]. Some advantages of these techniques are low computational cost and high generalization capability. Deep learning is a subbranch of machine learning, and it has the capability to deal with a large dataset [20,33]. Recent studies have proposed the 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for structural damage detection and localization [8,10,13,20]. The main advantage of 1D-CNN is automatic feature extraction performed through its initial convolutional layers [10,13,34]. However, CNN has a high computational cost, and its architecture design is a difficult task [35].\nSeveral strategies using ANN for damage localization and classification in plate-like structures have been proposed. Lu et al. [36] implemented an inverse method based on the feedforward artificial neural network for damage identification using PZT transducers. The ANN configuration (the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer) was determined using a rule of thumb. The discrete wavelet transform was applied to signal denoising before feature extraction. Yelve and Mulla [37] proposed damage detection in an aluminum plate using ANN and PZT transducers. The ANN inputs were damage indexes obtained from twelve actuator sensor paths, and the specific software selected the ANN architecture automatically. Feng et al. [30] presented two methods for damage detection in anisotropic wovenfabric carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate using PZT transducers. The first method was a probabilistic approach by constructing a probability matrix, and the second method was an ANN. The ANN inputs were the time-of-flight of the wave acquired by PZT transducers, and a try-and-error method selected the ANN configuration. Hesser et al. [38] proposed an ANN and support vector machine to locate low impact in the aluminum plate. An ANN with one hidden layer was proposed, and the number of neurons was found through a try-and-error method. However, these approaches do not use any method to find an optimized ANN topology. The best choice of neural network topology, weight values, and activation function for a particular application is a difficult task. ANN topology has a high impact on its performance. A small number of neurons may reduce the ANN learning capacity, but an excessive number of neurons may reduce its generalization capacity [39].\nIn this context, the metaheuristic approach formulates the ANN parameter identification task into an optimization problem. The most common method is ANN weight optimization where the metaheuristic algorithm searches for the weight values that minimize a cost function. This approach focuses on the ANN training process where the metaheuristic algorithm provides a way to escape from local minimums, which is the main problem in standard gradient-based methods. Several metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed to improve the ANN training process, such as genetic algorithm [40,41], particle swarm optimization [42], and grasshopper optimization [43]. However, to improve the ANN performance, the cost function needs to balance the weight values, ANN topology, and learning parameters. The genetic algorithm is the common metaheuristic method of ANN architecture optimization [44][45][46][47].\nThe Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm (MPCA) is a metaheuristic that minimizes a mono-objective function providing the simplest neural network topology (lowest number of neurons and faster convergence during the training phase) with the best performance (lowest error) [48]. The MPCA optimization algorithm takes into account all relevant ANN parameters as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, the weight values, the learning rate, the momentum constant, and the activation function [49]. MPCA has been successfully applied to climate prediction applications [39]. The present paper proposes an optimized ANN for damage detection in a plate-like structure using the MPCA. For the first time in the literature, the ANN optimized by MPCA is applied to find damages in plate-like structures. The ANN inputs are the time-of-flight of the Lamb wave reflection captured by four piezoelectric transducers, and the ANN output is the damage localization.\nIn the damage localization methods using ANN, a common approach is to use four PZT transducers placed in the corner of the inspected plate region [30,36,37]. The damage position is estimated using the time-of-flight information. This configuration is similar to a pitch-catch method finding damages in the delimited area by the transducers. In the present paper, a linear array of PZT transducers is investigated. The transducer placement is similar to a phased-array configuration, so the damage location information is strongly related to the time-of-flight and the time delay between adjacent transducers [18]. Using a linear array of transducers is possible to inspect a large area of the plate.\nIn the proposed damage localization method, due to the importance of the ToF estimation, the continuous wavelet transform is implemented to improve the arrival time measurement of the scattered wave from damage. The mother 2 Journal of Sensors wavelet is the main CWT parameter, as it may significantly influence the performance of the transformation. Recent works have proposed wavelet transform for damage detection and localization [4,6,30]. However, these works do not investigate a quantitative approach for mother wavelet selection. The present work uses a quantitative criterion, based on the Shannon entropy calculation, to select the best mother wavelet function [50]. The Shannon entropy criterion selects the most relevant scale values, reducing the CWT calculation. The proposed new method combines two optimization approaches: optimized ANN by MPCA and optimized CWT by entropy criterion. The experimental verification of the proposed method is performed on an aluminum plate structure. A mass of lead is employed to simulate several damage scenarios, providing a database for training the ANN and 1D-CNN. The performance of the proposed method is compared with two 1D-CNN. The first 1D-CNN uses as input the ToF features extracted using CWT, and the second 1D-CNN performs feature extraction directly from raw data acquired from PZT transducers. A discussion about the advantages and limitations of the proposed method is presented.\n\nBackground\n2.1. Continuous Wavelet Transform. Continuous wavelet transform CWT is a linear transformation that decomposes the input signal x\u00f0t\u00de over the scaled and translated versions of the mother wavelet \u03c8\u00f0t\u00de, as shown by the following equation [51]: where s is the scale, \u03c4 is the translation parameter, and \u00f0 * \u00de indicates the complex conjugate of mother wavelet function \u03c8\u00f0t\u00de. Using a proper scale-to-frequency relationship, CWT provides a time-frequency analysis similar to the short-time Fourier transform. However, CWT is more effective in representing nonstationary signals in the time-frequency domain [52,53]. A challenge in using wavelet transform is to establish a criterion to select the mother wavelet. A usual qualitative approach is a method based on a similarity between the mother wavelet and the analyzed signal.\nA suitable quantitative approach is Shannon entropybased optimization. This criterion consists of calculating the normalized Shannon entropy of the CWT coefficients as defined by [50]: where s is the scale vector with M elements, T s is the sample time, and N is the number of samples of the x\u00f0t\u00de signal. Shannon entropy measures the CWT randomness in the timescale domain, where a low entropy value indicates high energy concentration. Therefore, the best mother wavelet has the lowest value of Shannon entropy (Sh).\n\nHilbert\nTransform. The Hilbert transform F Hi \u00f0t\u00de of the real signal x\u00f0t\u00de can be represented by the equation below [54]: The Fourier transform of the F Hi \u00f0t\u00de signal is expressed as where sgn \u00f0\u03c9\u00de is the sign function, X\u00f0\u03c9\u00de is the Fourier transform of input signal x\u00f0t\u00de, and i is the imaginary number. According to Equation (5), the Hilbert transform is a filter in which the amplitudes of spectral components of the input signal x\u00f0t\u00de are left unchanged, but their phases are shifted by 90 degrees (see [54] page 359). This property can be used to calculate the instantaneous amplitude, or envelope, of signal x\u00f0t\u00de.\nThe R\u00f0t\u00de envelope of signal x\u00f0t\u00de is given by [52,54] 2.3. Artificial Neural Networks. Artificial neural networks are computational methods that emulate the human brain learning process. The simple processing units, known as artificial neurons, compose the ANN and are organized through several layers. Typically, the ANN has one input layer, one or more hidden layers, and one output layer. The synaptic weights interconnect the neurons and store the ANN knowledge [39,55]. Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) is a feed-forward model used mainly as a classifier, associative memory, or regression. Figure 1 shows an MLP neural network with just one hidden layer, where Equations (7) and (8) describe the neuron x n of the hidden layer and the neuron y k of the output layer, respectively, being b \u03b1 \u03b2 (\u03b1 = x, y and \u03b2 = n, m) the bias, v nm and \u03c9 kn the weight matrices of the connection between the neuron x n and the neuron z m , and y k with the neuron x n . The neuron 3 Journal of Sensors activation function g 1,2 \u00f0\u00b7\u00de is a nonlinear and smooth function [55]. The frequently used activation functions are sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent.\nANN training is the neuron's weight adjustment process and can be supervised or unsupervised. For an MLP-NN, the gradient-based and stochastic-based approaches are the main supervised training methods [43]. Among gradient-based methods, the frequently used is back-propagation. The back-propagation algorithm calculates the new weights using two steps: forward and backward [39]. In the first step, the input data is applied to the MLP-NN input, starting the data processing. The MLP-NN forward calculations propagate the results layer-by-layer producing the MLP-NN output. The network output y k is subtracted from an expected output of d k to produce an error value [55]: After that, this error is backward propagated from the MLP-NN output to the input. Finally, the neuron weights are adjusted using the delta rule for minimizing the calculated error.\n\nJournal of Sensors\nThe delta rule can be expressed as [55]: where \u0394v nm and \u0394\u03c9 kn are the weight correction factors and \u03b7 is the learning rate parameter. The feed-forward neural networks are popular mainly because of their generalization capability. The generalization refers to the ANN ability to correctly process data that is not part of training data. Therefore, the generalization performance can be estimated by The P data elements are not part of the K data elements-those ones were used to train the ANN [49].\n\n1D Convolutional Neural\nNetworks. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were inspired by the mammalian nervous system. The usual applications of CNN are regression and classification problems [34]. Typically, a CNN is composed of three types of processing layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected neural network (FCN) layers. Figure 2 shows an example of 1D-CNN.\nA convolutional layer extracts relevant features from the input data. Equation (13) describes the convolution operation between layers l and l \u2212 1: where y l k is the output, b l k is the bias of the k th neuron at layer l, s l\u22121 i is the output of the i th neuron at layer l \u2212 1, \u03c9 ik l\u22121 is the kernel from the i th neuron at layer l \u2212 1 to the k th at layer l, and Conv1D\u00f0\u00b7\u00de is the 1D discrete convolution without zero padding [34]. The pooling layer performs a downsampling operation resulting in a dimensional reduction. Pooling    Journal of Sensors   Journal of Sensors could be max-pooling or average pooling. The fully connected layer corresponds to MLP-NN.\n\nOptimal Neural Network Architecture by Multiple\nParticle Collision Algorithm. The identification of the best ANN configuration for a given application and data is a challenging task. One standard procedure is to do several experiments with different ANN configurations for getting acceptable results. The specialist changes the values of ANN parameters for each trial and compares the results with the observed values until finding a set of the most suitable parameters in his judgment [49]. An alternative approach is to formulate the task of identifying the best ANN topology as an optimization problem [56].\nThe goal of optimization problems is finding the suitable hyperparameters of a set that maximizes or minimizes a function, defined as an objective function or cost function. The objective function used in this work is given by [57] f obj = penalty \u00d7 \u03c1 1 \u00d7 E train + \u03c1 2 \u00d7 E gen \u03c1 1 + \u03c1 2 , \u00f014\u00de The first term of Equation (14) is the penalty factor, and the second term is the weighted mean of two errors: train error E train and generalization error E gen . Equation (15) shows the penalty term to evaluate the number of neurons and the epochs to perform the training [49]. The parameter values used in this work are \u03c1 1 = 1, \u03c1 2 = 0:1, C 1 = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , and C 2 = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 .\nThe MPCA optimization strategy must find the ANN configuration that minimizes the objective function (Equation (14)).\nThe ANN parameters taken into account by MPCA are the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, the weight values, the learning rate \u03b7, the momentum constant \u03b1, and the activation function [49].\nThe MPCA is a version of the particle collision algorithm (PCA). The PCA is a stochastic optimization algorithm inspired by the neutron travelling in a nuclear reactor, where two main phenomena can occur: scattering and absorption. The MPCA is a modified version of the particle collision algorithm that uses several particles to explore the search space [48]. Algorithm 1 shows the MPCA pseudocode.\nThe MPCA starts with a random ANN configuration (Old-Config). The Fitness() function calculates Equation (14) that evaluates the ANN configuration performance and updates the Best-Fitness information. For each particle, a stochastic perturbation (function Perturbation()) generates a new ANN configuration (New-Config) closer than the previous one, and the Fitness() function calculates the fitness of it. If New-Config is better than Old-Config, this new configuration is absorbed (the New-Config becomes an Old-Config for the next iterations). The function Exploration() generates small perturbations on closer positions. However, if New-Config is worse than Old-Config, the function Scattering() sends the particle to a different location of the search space trying to escape the local minimum [56]. The blackboard\n\nExperimental Setup and Results\nThe validation scenario of the proposed damage detection method is an aluminum plate (500 mm \u00d7 500 mm \u00d7 1 mm) with four PZT transducers bounded on its surface, as represented by Figure 3. These transducers, which have a 20 mm diameter, are arranged with a space of 5 mm and labeled as R0, R1, R2, and T0. Figure 3 shows twelve square sectors (50 mm sides) that delimit the damage scan region. The Lamb wave excitation signal is produced by transducer T0 and received by the other four transducers (R0, R1, R2, and R3). Figure 4 shows the experiment setup. The DE1-SoC (System-on-Chip) Development board has a hardware design platform which combines the dual-core Cortex-A9 embedded cores with FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). This board is programmed to generate a Gaussian window five cycles sine tone burst through a look-up table implemented in programmable logic and using a DAC (10 bits) converter. The DAC signal is amplified by the power circuit; then, the output signal generates the Lamb waves through the PZT transducer T0. The sine signal is generated with three different frequencies: 12 kHz, 16 kHz, and 20 kHz. The Lamb waves propagate through the aluminum board, and they are captured by the PZT transducers R0, R1, R2, and R3. The 12-bit ADC converts the analog voltage from the PZT transducers into digital signals. The sampling rate is set to 400 kHz.\nTwo signals received by sensor R0 are plotted in Figure 5(a). The first signal (black color) corresponds to the undamaged condition, and the second signal (red color) represents the signal received when damage occurs on sector S5. The excitation arrow indicates the direct wave received from the T0 transducer, and the damage arrow indicates the reflected wave by the damage, as shown in Figure 5(a). Figure 5(b) shows the difference signal, corresponding to the damage signal subtracted from the undamaged signal.\nIn the next step, the continuous wavelet transform of the difference signal is performed using six different mother wavelets. Figure 6 presents the normalized Shannon entropy of the CWT coefficients. The selected mother wavelet is the mexh (Mexican hat) which has the minimum entropy.\nThe resultant scalogram is plotted in Figure 7(b). The CWT minimum entropy signal, shown in Figure 7(c), is constructed from the scalogram by getting the CWT coefficients which scale has the minimum entropy value. The Hilbert transform of the CWT minimum entropy signal makes it possible to obtain the peak position as presented in Figure 7(c). Table 1 shows the ANN inputs. The peak position of the minimum entropy CWT coefficient obtained for each sensor R0, R1, R2, and R3 is the ANN inputs. The ANN output is the damage coordinate (x, y).\nA mass of lead is employed to simulate damage in the aluminum plate. The training and validation databases are generated by placing the mass of lead in the center of each sector defined in Figure 3. A total of 3600 samples, 300 samples by sector, is used to train the networks. The total number of samples is randomly divided into three sets: 2520 samples are selected for training, 540 samples for validation, and 540 samples for generalization. The training set is used to update the ANN weights and biases. The validation set evaluates the ANN generalization performance during the training phase (cross-validation process). A poor generalization performance is signaled by the raising of the validation error [56]. The generalization set is used to evaluate the ANN generalization performance after the training process. Table 2 presents the ANN parameters found by the MPCA optimization algorithm. The parameters used in the MPCA are 10 particles using a multiprocessing machine (one particle per processor) and 30 iterations (a scheme used to explore a better solution around the new particle location), and the stopping criterion is the maximum of 300 objective function evaluations.\nThe MPCA-ANN results are compared with two 1D-CNN. The 1D-CNN-CWT uses the same dataset applied to MPCA-ANN. This dataset corresponds to the features extracted using the CWT as defined in Table 1. The 1D-CNN-RAW uses the raw signals acquired by the PZT sensors. The mean square    Table 3 shows the 1D-CNN-CWT architecture.\nFor 1D-CNN-RAW, the training parameters are batch size of 32, learning rate of 1e \u2212 4, and 200 epochs. Table 4 shows the 1D-CNN-RAW architecture. Table 5 shows the dataset division by sector. The damage is simulated placing the mass in the center of the sector indicated by the first column of Table 5. The second column of Table 5 presents the damage location represented by Cartesian's coordinates which origin is the corner of sector S12. The last three columns of Table 5 present the rootmean-square error (RMSE) of the estimated damage position by MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT, and 1D-CNN-RAW, respectively. Equation (16) calculates the RMSE of the damage positions, where \u00f0x ann \u00f0n\u00de, y ann \u00f0n\u00de\u00de is the damage position estimated by ANN and \u00f0x\u00f0n\u00de, y\u00f0n\u00de\u00de is the real damage position: Figure 8 shows the MPCA-ANN performance. The real damage position (the mass position in the aluminum board) is represented by blue color, and the estimated damage position by ANN is represented by red color.\nIn order to evaluate the MPCA-ANN generalization capability, experiments were performed with mass placed in the vertices of sectors S6 and S7. The second column of Table 6 presents each vertex location represented by Cartesian's coordinates which origin is the corner of sector S12. 200 experiments were performed for each vertex. The last three columns of Table 6 present the RMSE of the estimated damage position by MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT, and 1D-CNN-RAW, respectively. Figure 9 shows the damage position estimated by MPCA-ANN for each case of Table 6. Each plot of Figure 9 represents the physical aluminum board; the red points show the estimated damage position and the blue cross the real damage position.\n\nDiscussion\nThe minimum Shannon entropy selected the Mexican hat as the best choice for the mother wavelet as shown by Figure 6. The CWT performance can be visualized by Figures 7(b) and 7(c). The results presented by these figures indicate that the CWT can be evaluated only on the scale with minimum entropy value, where more energy concentration exists. The comparison between Figures 7(a) and 7(b) shows that the CWT using the Mexican hat as the mother wavelet, calculated in the scale with minimum entropy, can estimate the peak position of the Lamb wave reflection signal.\nThe MPCA algorithm found the ANN architecture shown in Table 2. The ANN training performance result, presented in Figure 8, indicates that the ANN can find the correct damage    Table 5 shows the training results for the MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT. and 1D-CNN-RAW. The ANN-MPCA presented a good performance in comparison with the two versions of 1D-CNN. The results of Table 6 show the good generalization capability of MPCA-ANN when compared with the 1D-CNN-CWT and 1D-CNN-RAW.\nA metric termed mean normalized distance (MND) [13] is used to compare the global result of the generalization performance. The distance values are normalized with length of the inspected board region. Equation (17) describes the MND metric: ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi x n ann n \u00f0 \u00de \u2212 x n n \u00f0 \u00de \u00f0 \u00de 2 + y n ann n \u00f0 \u00de \u2212 y n n \u00f0 \u00de \u00f0 where \u00f0x n ann , y n ann \u00de is the normalized damage position found by ANN, \u00f0x n , y n \u00de is the real normalized position of damage, and N is the number of samples. The normalized coordinate x n corresponds to the division of x by 200 mm (length of inspected area), and the normalized coordinate y n corresponds to the division of y by 150 mm (length of inspected area). Table 7 shows MND values for the three algorithms, with errors of order O\u00f010 \u22121 \u00de, and the best performance was the 1D-CNN-RAW.\nThe MND results presented in Table 7 show that 1D-CNN-RAW with features extracted directly from raw data presents the same generalization performance in comparison with the 1D-CNN-CWT. This result shows the good damage localization information contained in ToF features extracted using the CWT optimized by entropy calculation. Normally, the CWT performs several convolutional operations using different scale values. The CWT operation has high computational cost. However, the entropy method limits the CWT just to optimum scale value reducing the computational cost of the CWT operation. Therefore, the 1D-CNN-CWT has the same performance as 1D-CNN-RAW but with a low computational cost. The 1D-CNN-RAW uses two convolutional layers, while 1D-CNN-CWT uses just one convolutional layer. Table 8 shows an estimated computational cost comparison between MPCA-ANN, 1D-CNN-CWT, and 1D-CNN-RAW. The computational cost is indirectly estimated by the number of convolutions, the number of neurons, and the number of weights.\nBoth 1D-CNN methods presented a better generalization performance in comparison with MPCA-ANN. This result confirms the great 1D-CNN capability to extract relevant features from input data. However, the 1D-CNN structure has a high computational cost. The 1D-CNN-CWT architecture, presented in Table 3, has two fully connected layers with 60 neurons, while the 1D-CNN-RAW architecture, presented in Table 4, has one fully connected layer with 60 neurons. The generalization performance of MPCA-ANN with only one hidden layer and five neurons was close to the complex 1D-CNN structures. An estimated computational cost is presented in Table 8. The lowest computational effort is linked to the MPCA-ANN, due to the design based on searching the simplest neural architecture. Such low neural network complexity shows the adequacy for embedded applications, with limited computational capacity, or to be implemented in a hardware processing device, maintaining a good generalization capability.\n\nConclusion\nIn this paper, an optimized artificial neural network is proposed to locate damages into plate-like structures. The Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm finds the most adequate ANN architecture for the considered dataset. The experimental results of damage detection and localization in an aluminum plate validate the effectiveness of MPCA in finding a simple and optimized ANN architecture with good generalization capability. The generalization performance of MPCA-ANN was compared with two 1D-CNN. The results  show that MPCA-ANN has a good performance in comparison with complex 1D-CNN structures. The continuous wavelet transform processes the Lamb wave reflections and improves the time-of-flight estimation. The Shannon entropy-based criterion finds the best mother wavelet and scale values for detecting the Lamb wave reflections. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimized CWT. In future works, this method will be extended to more complex plate-like structures such as composite structures.\n\nData Availability\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.\nWrite a 500-word creative story: The 4.

Include a compelling plot and rich description. The main character should be faced with an ethical dilemma.\nOnce upon a time in the beautiful town of New York, there lived a kind and generous man named Mr. Thompson. He was well known throughout the city for his generous acts of charity towards those less fortunate than him. One day, while walking home from work, Mr. Thompson came across a young boy begging for food. His stomach growled hungrily, but he couldn't bring himself to accept the boy's offer.\n\nFeeling sympathetic towards the child, Mr. Thompson decided to buy the boy dinner instead. However, when he went inside the restaurant, he discovered that they did not accept credit cards due to limited funds. Despite feeling disheartened, Mr. Thompson didn't give up hope yet and thought of other ways to pay for the boy's meal.\n\nRemembering his emergency fund, Mr. Thompson quickly pulled out enough cash to cover the cost of the boy's meal. As he handed over the money, the cashier asked him where he had gotten the money so suddenly. Caught off guard, Mr. Thompson hesitated momentarily before admitting that he had taken the money from a stranger who sat next to him earlier.\n\nThough taken aback by this revelation, the cashier took pity on Mr. Thompson and allowed him to purchase the boy's meal. After exchanging pleasantries, Mr. Thompson left the restaurant feeling proud of himself for making a good decision even under pressure.\n\nHowever, later that night, Mr. Thompson received a phone call informing him that the stranger whose wallet he took had reported the theft. Shocked, Mr. Thompson realized that he had crossed a line by stealing someone else's property.\n\nReflecting on his actions, Mr. Thompson felt guilty and remorseful. But despite this, he knew deep down that taking the stranger's wallet was wrong and that he must face the consequences of his actions. And thus, Mr. Thompson found himself facing an ethical dilemma - whether to confess to the crime or deny it altogether.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Thompson chose to confess to the crime and accept any punishment that came with it. Although he feared retaliation from the stranger, Mr. Thompson believed that admitting his wrongdoing would help him learn valuable lessons about honesty and integrity. Plus, he hoped that his confession might lead others to consider their own moral compasses and make better choices going forward.\n\nAnd so, Mr.", "completion_only": "The story should build up to a twist or a surprise ending.

As he handed over the money, the cashier asked him where he had gotten the money so suddenly. Caught off guard, Mr. Thompson hesitated momentarily before admitting that he had taken the money from a stranger who sat next to him earlier.\n\nThough taken aback by this revelation, the cashier took pity on Mr. Thompson and allowed him to purchase the boy's meal. After exchanging pleasantries, Mr. Thompson left the restaurant feeling proud of himself for making a good decision even under pressure.\n\nHowever, later that night, Mr. Thompson received a phone call informing him that the stranger whose wallet he took had reported the theft. Shocked, Mr. Thompson realized that he had crossed a line by stealing someone else's property.\n\nReflecting on his actions, Mr. Thompson felt guilty and remorseful. But despite this, he knew deep down that taking the stranger's wallet was wrong and that he must face the consequences of his actions. And thus, Mr. Thompson found himself facing an ethical dilemma - whether to confess to the crime or deny it altogether.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Thompson chose to confess to the crime and accept any punishment that came with it. Although he feared retaliation from the stranger, Mr. Thompson believed that admitting his wrongdoing would help him learn valuable lessons about honesty and integrity. Plus, he hoped that his confession might lead others to consider their own moral compasses and make better choices going forward.\n\nAnd so, Mr.", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 88, "avg_token_entropy": 0.8558163840025672, "avg_token_perplexity": 3.4268305517171416, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

Young people who went to US hospitals complained of shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea, and when examined, doctors found signs that looked like burns. At the moment, the cause of the disease is considered to be a sticky substance called vitamin E acetate contained in vaping fluids. There is no effective method for treating this mysterious disease, and the only option is transplanting healthy lungs from donors. Recently, the first transplant was performed at the Henry Ford Hospital in the US state of Michigan, which saved the life of a 17-year-old.\nAccording to The Washington Post, he wasHe was hospitalized on September 5, and a week later his condition worsened to such an extent that he had to be connected to a ventilator. A week later, he was transferred to the Michigan Children's Hospital and connected to the apparatus to maintain the functioning of the heart and other organs. When the teenager was close to death, the doctors decided to add him to the list of queues for receiving donor lungs, where, due to his deplorable state, the guy climbed to the top lines.

We want to share those memories with all of you. The pages that follow will never tell the whole story of Don and his impact on our lives.\nDon and I worked on many, many projects together at church. We strung wires to power the air conditioners for the classrooms. That turned out to be a beast of job. He showed me how to light the coal furnace\u2026just dump diesel fuel on the coal and light it with a torch. He taught me how to replace the main breaker box in the parsonage without shutting off the electrical power\u2026quite a hair-raising experience!\nWe worked to unplug the sewer line to the north janitor\u2019s closet.  As we were cutting with the Sawsall, we hit the copper water line. Well out shoots the water! I had to scramble to shut off the main water valve. Then Don simply patched the leak with a hose clamp and a piece of rubber.\nOne of the funniest jobs we did was to install a refrigerated water fountain between the girls\u2019 bathroom and the library. There was an old water fountain there, but we needed to reconfigure the drain for the new water fountain. We knew the drain line was in the wall some place, but we didn\u2019t know where. We bashed about 6 holes in the wall looking for the drainpipe. All those holes looked pretty silly when we finally found it!\nToday we are wearing matching ties. Don was always proud of his John 3:16 tie. He always commented on our matching ties.\nI remember my folks going out to Morristown to visit Donnie and Dorothy. Once when Marvin and I were old enough we hiked all the way to the North Dakota border! We had such fun stepping over the \u201cboundary\u201d line.\nOne summer Dad hired Donnie and Marvin to work for him. They ate meals with us in the house, but slept in the shop. At least a couple of times my sisters and I short-sheeted their bed.\nWe got to know Donnie better after he moved the family to the little house at Grandma Rose\u2019s. When we\u2019d visit Grandma, there were always kids to play with. Many a summer\u2019s day was spent playing softball, baseball, football, and hid and seek.\nDonnie often picked us kids up and took us to school. I don\u2019t remember how many kids would be piled and stacked in the Chrysler, but away we\u2019d go, listening to the sports reports on the radio, arguing or telling jokes.\nDonnie has been an inspiration to me, especially in the last years. No matter if he couldn\u2019t hear well or if his knee hurt, he had a smile.\nI know that smile came from \u201csomething\u201d deep inside \u2013 the knowledge that he was a child of God, a forgiven sinner, and a child of the KING.\nDon let me use his old backhoe top dig out a basement.\nDon and I were wiring one day and he intentionally stapled the wire of the fuse box so I would think it wasn\u2019t long enough.\nI remember him telling how he wired his van up so that it could give GOOD shock to all dogs that wanted to water the wheels! He used an old coil and had it so he could activate it with a switch.\nI visited him in the hospital, on the phone and in the home \u2013 each time it was a privilege to share encouragement from God\u2019s Word, but at the same time he encouraged me as he spoke of his Savior\u2019s love and care.\nI always enjoyed Don, as he was always interested in the same things that I am.\nI always enjoyed visiting with Don at family reunions. I could tell he really enjoyed being with his family. He had a story for everything.\nI\u2019m going to miss the political discussions Don and I used to have. (We both liked Rush Limbaugh.) I always loved the good times and wonderful food and fun we shared at their house. We\u2019ll miss him very much.\nDonnie was my son\u2019s (Daniel Orth) babysitter for 5 years. They use to go outside to his garden and shop. In church when I would go up to communion, I remember Donnie holding out his arms to take him while I went up. Sometimes he would motion to just leave him there after that.\nThere are too many memories to count. He was always laughing or smiling. When life wasn\u2019t all that great sometimes, he still would tell people not to take any wooden nickels. I remember the times we would spend at Grandpa and Grandma\u2019s house during the summer. Everyone in town knew him and it would take forever just to go to the grocery store because he would stop to talk to people.\nI remember his truck with the square wheels and the van with the sunflower seeds he would have in it. There are so many more, but not enough ink and paper. I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s in heaven now listening to the crickets he hasn\u2019t heard in such a long time.\nI remember the summers I spent at their house and all the fun things I did with Grandpa. One I remember very clearly was going West River in his old van. It was fun!\nI also remember riding in the truck with square wheels to go pick up some wood for his wood burner. It was a lot of fun, but very bumpy.\nThere are lots more memories I have of Grandpa, but there would not be enough paper or ink for them all. I\u2019m glad he is in heaven so he can finally hear without a hearing aid.\nI worked with Don in 1973 and 1974 on scattered sites on the Standing Rock Reservation. We were suppose to plumb the water from the newly dug wells to the house. The days were long and hot.\nWe had to find new places in the old International van every once in a while to hide our 6-pack of beer. Others would find it before we were ready to quit for the day.\nEvery time I went over to Don\u2019s when he had a little job for me, we\u2019d have to discuss the job over his daughter\u2019s beer.\nDon was our handyman at the Barkers Bootery and even anything that went wrong at our house.\nHe will be missed. I met him many times at the store and always visited with him. He loved to visit.\nDon had an outlook on life that we should all try to mimic and duplicate \u2013 nothing phased his positive outlook or his concern for others. He will be missed.\nOne thing I remember, before Robert and I were married, Robert and Don went for an airplane ride. Don and Robert were both young and foolish and Don took him for a ride. I wasn\u2019t there, but I know they were doing some \u201ctricks.\u201d  Robert couldn\u2019t give me a kiss when he got back because of a sore mouth!\nOur families have always been good friends. We had our children in school with theirs way back in the grades. Don and Dorothy always welcomed them into their home.\nWhat I member best from serving Don in the hospital is that I always felt the Lord used Don to build me up more than I could have encouraged him. Don\u2019s optimism and Don\u2019s willingness to share his faith in Christ with everyone is an example I pray we all might follow.\nI\u2019m sure there are a lot of things I remember about Don if I took a few minutes, but the one thing that comes to mind immediately is how he delighted my children by wiggling his ears.\nDon Rabenberg was God\u2019s Guardian Angel. He loved to share plants, knowledge, and seed order books. He dearly loved his green house and the healthy plants he grew. Don had all kinds of garden advice and he was a great garden giant.\nDon was such an inspiring person. He always encouraged me to do my best and to give all the love I could give to someone and then give them more.\nHe would support me no matter what, and I could always count on him. When I made him a Valentine one year, (it was quickly made and pretty sloppy) he said that he was proud of me and he said that he would admire it forever. That just tells you that he was such a great person.\nI think I was about seven years old and I was staying at Grandpa and Grandma\u2019s house for a few weeks. One night before bed, he took me on his lap and showed me this article he was reading about the Seven Wonders of the World.\nThe next fall when I was back in school, I told the class about them. I don\u2019t remember all seven of them anymore, but it was fun learning about them.\nDonnie was always the first to search me out in the \u201cRabenberg Crowd\u201d to ask if I was really, really sure I knew what I was getting into. He seemed to always know when I needed a smile and a break in the action.\nDon was the #1 plumber when we built our house in 1978-79. When I went over to paint, and Don was there working, it seemed he never got anything done. He would spend the time just talking. I finally decided that if I ever wanted to move into that house and have running water, I best let Don work alone. Then one day I had to wash out paintbrushes and since we were hauling water in jugs, I first rinsed it out in a rain puddle. He really teased me about that!\nThen I have to thank Don for the jeans he gave me to use for quilts. He said he had a \u201cfew\u201d pair \u2013 it turned out to be 76 pair! They made quite a few quilts.\nWhen Don and Dorothy came back from their honeymoon, they had the first margarine that I had ever seen. You had to squeeze the tubes of margarine to mix the yellow color through it. We always had real butter made with real cream. So this margarine was so fascinating to me.\nWalt Balliet called him a genius and who could find a better description of my brother-in-law, Don, who always had a simple, practical solution to all our plumbing and electrical problems.\nI also have many memories of Don Rabenberg. My sister Betty first had his children in school when she took her first teaching call at Morristown, SD with all 8 grades. Then when I taught in Mobridge I had Llewellyn and Rise. Whenever I bragged about my students, Betty would say that they had a good start out in Morristown!! ;-) When I think about it, Don was the first person to step into the doorway of my classroom when I first got to Mobridge, and he told me that he knew how I got the call out there. I should have made him elaborate, but I just thought that the Lord had the biggest hand in it. There is always a reason why the Lord places us where we are to work and witness.\nIn the last few months, I was interested in the nutrition that Don was using, so we shared many e-mails and even a few phone calls about that. I am sure that his nutrition regimen added to his stay with us. I shared what he gave me with a neighbor lady who has now just completed her treatments for cancer and is on a maintenance program. Once again it reminded me of the saying that what blesses one, blesses all. It certainly is true of God's Word. Don really had that part down and was able to share it very well. I read the other memories on the web page, and over and over the statement was there that he would be missed. He truly left a Christian legacy for all his family and friends. We will do well to copy his example. I hope that I am able to say that I am \"terrific\" when I am asked how I am feeling when I have a serious illness. When I shut my eyes, I can see his smile. He was a special \"Don\" to many. The best part is that he is even more \"terrific\" now and sharing the blessings of eternity.\nNo collection of stories about Dad would be complete without mention of his legendary tree-stump caper. He did this in the middle 70's, when Ted Biehl was his neighbor to the south. Anyone who remembers Ted Biehl will recall that he was a most fastidious man, caring for his yard with a level of attention to detail that would make any landscape artist proud. It was Ted's fastidiousness that made this caper so effective. Now, my understanding is that the germ of the idea came from my brother Lew; he and Dad carried the idea through to completion.\nTed had a row of trees in his back yard, medium-sized trees with trunks about eight inches in diameter. Dad acquired some lengths of tree trunk of similar diameter. He bolted two steel rods about three feet long to one face of one of these trunk pieces, and then, one weekend when Ted was away, \"planted\" the piece of tree trunk in Ted's yard, at the end of his row of trees. The steel rods anchored the \"stump\" firmly. The visual effect was that the last tree in the row had been cut down. To enhance the effect, Dad sprinkled sawdust around the stump.\nTed returned home late at night; very tired, he went straight to bed. The next morning, he was at Dad and Mom's back door, quite early. He was so agitated and upset he almost couldn't speak. He finally got his question out: \"Did you see someone cut down one of my trees?\" Dad replied innocently that he had not. This made Ted even more agitated as he exclaimed, \"Someone cut down one of my trees!\"\nDad, feigning surprise, asked to see. Ted led him to the stump. Dad looked at it, and then kicked it. Of course, being securely anchored, it did not budge. \"But I didn't have a tree there!\" Ted cried out in bewilderment and frustration. At that point, Dad could no longer maintain his poker face, and so he reached down and pulled the stump up. Ted's eyes grew bigger and bigger as he realized how he'd been had by Dad.\nOf all Dad's jokes and pranks, this one certainly was among the most memorable!\n", "prompt": "On the day we all gathered for the funeral of Don, many of us took a few minutes to write down some thoughts about him. We want to share those memories with all of you. The pages that follow will never tell the whole story of Don and his impact on our lives.\nDon and I worked on many, many projects together at church. We strung wires to power the air conditioners for the classrooms. That turned out to be a beast of job. He showed me how to light the coal furnace\u2026just dump diesel fuel on the coal and light it with a torch. He taught me how to replace the main breaker box in the parsonage without shutting off the electrical power\u2026quite a hair-raising experience!\nWe worked to unplug the sewer line to the north janitor\u2019s closet.  As we were cutting with the Sawsall, we hit the copper water line. Well out shoots the water! I had to scramble to shut off the main water valve. Then Don simply patched the leak with a hose clamp and a piece of rubber.\nOne of the funniest jobs we did was to install a refrigerated water fountain between the girls\u2019 bathroom and the library. There was an old water fountain there, but we needed to reconfigure the drain for the new water fountain. We knew the drain line was in the wall some place, but we didn\u2019t know where. We bashed about 6 holes in the wall looking for the drainpipe. All those holes looked pretty silly when we finally found it!\nToday we are wearing matching ties. Don was always proud of his John 3:16 tie. He always commented on our matching ties.\nI remember my folks going out to Morristown to visit Donnie and Dorothy. Once when Marvin and I were old enough we hiked all the way to the North Dakota border! We had such fun stepping over the \u201cboundary\u201d line.\nOne summer Dad hired Donnie and Marvin to work for him. They ate meals with us in the house, but slept in the shop. At least a couple of times my sisters and I short-sheeted their bed.\nWe got to know Donnie better after he moved the family to the little house at Grandma Rose\u2019s. When we\u2019d visit Grandma, there were always kids to play with. Many a summer\u2019s day was spent playing softball, baseball, football, and hid and seek.\nDonnie often picked us kids up and took us to school. I don\u2019t remember how many kids would be piled and stacked in the Chrysler, but away we\u2019d go, listening to the sports reports on the radio, arguing or telling jokes.\nDonnie has been an inspiration to me, especially in the last years. No matter if he couldn\u2019t hear well or if his knee hurt, he had a smile.\nI know that smile came from \u201csomething\u201d deep inside \u2013 the knowledge that he was a child of God, a forgiven sinner, and a child of the KING.\nDon let me use his old backhoe top dig out a basement.\nDon and I were wiring one day and he intentionally stapled the wire of the fuse box so I would think it wasn\u2019t long enough.\nI remember him telling how he wired his van up so that it could give GOOD shock to all dogs that wanted to water the wheels! He used an old coil and had it so he could activate it with a switch.\nI visited him in the hospital, on the phone and in the home \u2013 each time it was a privilege to share encouragement from God\u2019s Word, but at the same time he encouraged me as he spoke of his Savior\u2019s love and care.\nI always enjoyed Don, as he was always interested in the same things that I am.\nI always enjoyed visiting with Don at family reunions. I could tell he really enjoyed being with his family. He had a story for everything.\nI\u2019m going to miss the political discussions Don and I used to have. (We both liked Rush Limbaugh.) I always loved the good times and wonderful food and fun we shared at their house. We\u2019ll miss him very much.\nDonnie was my son\u2019s (Daniel Orth) babysitter for 5 years. They use to go outside to his garden and shop. In church when I would go up to communion, I remember Donnie holding out his arms to take him while I went up. Sometimes he would motion to just leave him there after that.\nThere are too many memories to count. He was always laughing or smiling. When life wasn\u2019t all that great sometimes, he still would tell people not to take any wooden nickels. I remember the times we would spend at Grandpa and Grandma\u2019s house during the summer. Everyone in town knew him and it would take forever just to go to the grocery store because he would stop to talk to people.\nI remember his truck with the square wheels and the van with the sunflower seeds he would have in it. There are so many more, but not enough ink and paper. I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s in heaven now listening to the crickets he hasn\u2019t heard in such a long time.\nI remember the summers I spent at their house and all the fun things I did with Grandpa. One I remember very clearly was going West River in his old van. It was fun!\nI also remember riding in the truck with square wheels to go pick up some wood for his wood burner. It was a lot of fun, but very bumpy.\nThere are lots more memories I have of Grandpa, but there would not be enough paper or ink for them all. I\u2019m glad he is in heaven so he can finally hear without a hearing aid.\nI worked with Don in 1973 and 1974 on scattered sites on the Standing Rock Reservation. We were suppose to plumb the water from the newly dug wells to the house. The days were long and hot.\nWe had to find new places in the old International van every once in a while to hide our 6-pack of beer. Others would find it before we were ready to quit for the day.\nEvery time I went over to Don\u2019s when he had a little job for me, we\u2019d have to discuss the job over his daughter\u2019s beer.\nDon was our handyman at the Barkers Bootery and even anything that went wrong at our house.\nHe will be missed. I met him many times at the store and always visited with him. He loved to visit.\nDon had an outlook on life that we should all try to mimic and duplicate \u2013 nothing phased his positive outlook or his concern for others. He will be missed.\nOne thing I remember, before Robert and I were married, Robert and Don went for an airplane ride. Don and Robert were both young and foolish and Don took him for a ride. I wasn\u2019t there, but I know they were doing some \u201ctricks.\u201d  Robert couldn\u2019t give me a kiss when he got back because of a sore mouth!\nOur families have always been good friends. We had our children in school with theirs way back in the grades. Don and Dorothy always welcomed them into their home.\nWhat I member best from serving Don in the hospital is that I always felt the Lord used Don to build me up more than I could have encouraged him.

He bolted two steel rods about three feet long to one face of one of these trunk pieces, and then, one weekend when Ted was away, \"planted\" the piece of tree trunk in Ted's yard, at the end of his row of trees. The steel rods anchored the \"stump\" firmly. The visual effect was that the last tree in the row had been cut down. To enhance the effect, Dad sprinkled sawdust around the stump.\nTed returned home late at night; very tired, he went straight to bed. The next morning, he was at Dad and Mom's back door, quite early. He was so agitated and upset he almost couldn't speak. He finally got his question out: \"Did you see someone cut down one of my trees?\" Dad replied innocently that he had not. This made Ted even more agitated as he exclaimed, \"Someone cut down one of my trees!\"\nDad, feigning surprise, asked to see. Ted led him to the stump. Dad looked at it, and then kicked it. Of course, being securely anchored, it did not budge. \"But I didn't have a tree there!\" Ted cried out in bewilderment and frustration. At that point, Dad could no longer maintain his poker face, and so he reached down and pulled the stump up. Ted's eyes grew bigger and bigger as he realized how he'd been had by Dad.\nOf all Dad's jokes and pranks, this one certainly was among the most memorable!\n\nWrite a 500-word creative story: Start writing and don't stop until you reach the minimum word count.\n\nThe story should include the following character: Bobby, Age: 7, Homeless\n\nThe story should include the following organization: Bobby woke up in the morning cold and hungry.

The DPRK said it does not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons \u201cand therefore, there can be no \u2018nuclear\u2019 suspicion in our country.\u201d However, ElBaradei said his agency must assess this claim and since verification may take two to three years, work should begin immediately so that the light-water reactor project can proceed as scheduled.

The two are also scheduled to give \u201cmajor addresses\u201d at the concurrent APEC business leaders\u2019 forum.

According to the PRC\u2019s official Xinhua news agency, foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said that the bill interfered with the PRC\u2019s internal affairs by raising the issues of Taiwan, Tibet and human rights. Xinhua also said that the PRC has complained to the US and has urged US authorities to \u201coppose the anti-China provisions enshrined in the act, and take effective measures to prevent the act from becoming law.\u201d The US House of Representatives earlier this year agreed to set up the commission as a concession to critics of a congressional decision to grant PRC exporters full access to the US market, as part of a deal on PRC entry into the World Trade Organization.

According to international business rules, the DPRK is obliged to take full responsibility for all accidents stemming from the atomic power plant construction, but GE believes that the DPRK does not have the funds to do this, said Representative Kim Won-woon of the opposition Grand National Party (GNP). The ROK, while keeping the latest GE demand secret, had sought to make guarantees using its inter-Korean cooperation fund and other sources, but finally decided against it, he said. \u201cThe government has recently proposed to GE to come back to the project by acceding to international insurance but the U.S. company rejected the proposal, threatening the smooth proceedings of the project,\u201d Kim said.\nThe Korea Herald (Seo Soo-min, \u201cSIBLINGS OF SOUTH KOREAN SPIES SENT TO NK APPLIED FOR REUNION,\u201d Seoul, 11/07/00) reported that for the first time, siblings of ROK spies in the DPRK are confirmed to have applied for the inter-Korean family reunion, a ruling party policymaker revealed during ROK National Assembly inspections of the Unification Ministry on Monday. \u201cLee chae-pil, and Choi Tae-uk, both applied for their reunion with their brothers Chae-sung and Chin-uk, who were dispatched to North Korea as spies in 1970s and 50s, respectively,\u201d said Kim Seong-ho of the Millennium Democratic Party (MDP), calling for the government\u2019s recognition of the spies sent to the DPRK. Choi Tae-uk, an Inchon resident, applied to the Unification Ministry for reunion with his brother. The reason for separation he wrote, was that his brother was \u201cdispatched to the North on a spy mission around 1959-1960.\u201d The paper was turned in as evidence. Out of 7,726 spies listed as missing or dead during spy missions to the DPRK, at least 77 dispatched in the 1950s were confirmed to be alive in the DPRK, he said.\nChina Daily (\u201cUS, DPRK RESUME MISSILE TALKS,\u201d Kuala Lumpur, 11/02/00, P12) reported that in a move that could influence whether US President Clinton makes a trip to DPRK, officials from the two countries came on November 1 to Kuala Lumpur to resume missile talks.

Both sides spoke highly of the developments of bilateral relations.

The writer noted that after the end of the Cold War, when Japan and the US are seeking to establish alliance relationship on a global scale, the unsymmetrical characteristics existing in bilateral relations is being adjusted. However, the potential development of conflicts between Japan and US are inevitable and insurmountable. Three features\u2014global scale, symmetry and conflict, frame the Japan-US relations. Xu compared policies and actions of the two countries after the end of the Cold War to the motives and forms of Japan-US alliance during the Cold War, commenting that, in the new era, Japan and US have wider common interests and share similar values and ideology. While both emphasize the new global scale of their bilateral relations, Japan is driven by the idea of improving its political significance in the international community by allying with the US, while the US, still guided by the idea of leading the world, needs Japan due to its own relatively decline of economic capability. This in turn plays a restraining role on Japan\u2019s remilitarization. When shifting focus to diplomatic practice, Xu said, Japan and US have generally maintained a collaborative paradigm. On the symmetrical relationship issue, he argued that in the Cold War, Japan-US relations are extremely asymmetrical. However, with the development of Japan\u2019s economy, the voices for equal partnership in Japan increases. Since the end of the Cold War, Japan has become more strategically important to US leadership in its Pacific wing, which is fully expressed in the revised guidelines. The writer predicted that as long as Japan keeps its economic growth, it is only a matter of time to break the Japan-US asymmetrical relations. Being the most sophisticated of bilateral relations, Japan and US can not avoid the potential increase of conflict. Superficially speaking, conflict lies in trade disputes. The in-depth conflict is strategic.

The ROK, while keeping the latest GE demand secret, had sought to make guarantees using its inter-Korean cooperation fund and other sources, but finally decided against it, he said. \u201cThe government has recently proposed to GE to come back to the project by acceding to international insurance but the U.S. company rejected the proposal, threatening the smooth proceedings of the project,\u201d Kim said.\nThe Korea Herald (Seo Soo-min, \u201cSIBLINGS OF SOUTH KOREAN SPIES SENT TO NK APPLIED FOR REUNION,\u201d Seoul, 11/07/00) reported that for the first time, siblings of ROK spies in the DPRK are confirmed to have applied for the inter-Korean family reunion, a ruling party policymaker revealed during ROK National Assembly inspections of the Unification Ministry on Monday. \u201cLee chae-pil, and Choi Tae-uk, both applied for their reunion with their brothers Chae-sung and Chin-uk, who were dispatched to North Korea as spies in 1970s and 50s, respectively,\u201d said Kim Seong-ho of the Millennium Democratic Party (MDP), calling for the government\u2019s recognition of the spies sent to the DPRK. Choi Tae-uk, an Inchon resident, applied to the Unification Ministry for reunion with his brother. The reason for separation he wrote, was that his brother was \u201cdispatched to the North on a spy mission around 1959-1960.\u201d The paper was turned in as evidence. Out of 7,726 spies listed as missing or dead during spy missions to the DPRK, at least 77 dispatched in the 1950s were confirmed to be alive in the DPRK, he said.\nChina Daily (\u201cUS, DPRK RESUME MISSILE TALKS,\u201d Kuala Lumpur, 11/02/00, P12) reported that in a move that could influence whether US President Clinton makes a trip to DPRK, officials from the two countries came on November 1 to Kuala Lumpur to resume missile talks. The talks follow a meeting the previous week between US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and DPRK leader Kim Jong-il. \u201cSerious progress was made, including missile issues, but much work remains to be done,\u201d said Robert Einhorn, Assistant Secretary of State and head of the US delegation, of Albright\u2019s visit. \u201cThe talks of this week will build on discussions between Albright and Chairman Kim [Jong-il],\u201d Einhorn said. \u201cThe US will seek solutions that promote non-proliferation and promote regional and global security and help move DPRK-US relations forward.\u201d DPRK negotiator Jang Chang-chon, head of his country\u2019s Bureau of US Affairs, said that the talks at the US Embassy in Malaysia, seen by both countries as a neutral venue, were expected to last until Friday but could go longer. \u201cWe will discuss all issues, including our suspension of missile exports and the US launch of our satellites during the missile talks,\u201d Jang was quoted as saying by the ROK Yonhap News Agency.\nPeople\u2019s Daily (Zhang Jinyu, \u201cJIANG ZEMIN MEETS WITH RUSSIAN PM,\u201d Beijing, 11/04/00, P1), (Zhang Jinyu, \u201cLI PENG MEETS WITH RUSSIAN PM,\u201d Beijing, 11/04/00) and Xinhua News Agency (Che Yuming, Li Shijia, \u201cPRC PREMIER TALKS WITH RUSSIAN PM,\u201d Beijing, 11/03/00) reported that PRC government leaders who met with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and his delegation pledged to work for closer economic cooperation and inject life into the PRC-Russia strategic partnership. Both sides spoke highly of the developments of bilateral relations. They also exchanged views on issues of common ground and interest such as the establishment of a new world political order and the promotion and economic order and the promotion of a multi-polar world. Eight agreements dealing with forestry, minerals, science and technology and trade were signed. In a joint communique issued after a two-and-a-half hour closed meeting between officials from the two countries, PRC Premier Zhu Rongji and his Russian counterpart stressed their willingness to cooperate in areas such as trade and military technology. According to the communique, the two sides will improve ties in finance, banking, insurance, advertising, arbitration, and transportation, and will cooperate in nuclear energy, oil, gas and astronautics projects. In the communique, Kasyanov reiterated his government\u2019s support for the one-China principle, promising that Russia will neither support Taiwan\u2019s participation in any international organization where statehood is required nor sell weapons to Taiwan. Sino-Russian ties have never been better, Zhu said during the press conference.\nChina Daily (\u201cMILITARY LEADERS MEET, AGREE ABOUT SINO-US RELATIONS,\u201d Washington, 11/02/00, P1) reported that on Monday when meeting with visiting PRC General Yu Yongbo, Director of the General Political Department of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), US Defense Secretary William Cohen said that no matter who is elected in November, the next US President will attach great importance to Sino-US relations. Cohen also said that both the Democratic and Republican Parties have reached a consensus on the development of friendly ties with PRC. He stressed the need to further strengthen friendly relations between the two countries as well as the two militaries. The US and the PRC have a common interest in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole, he said. Cohen pointed out that the US Congress\u2019 passage of the bill on Permanent Normal Trade Relations with the PRC, which has already been signed into law by President Bill Clinton, will not only strengthen bilateral trade ties but also play a significant role in ensuring steady growth of the relations between the two countries. Yu said that the PRC government and military pay great attention to PRC-US relations, and the purpose of this current visit is to promote mutual understanding, expand common ground and strengthen ties. Yu described the Sino-US relationship as \u201cone of the most important bilateral ties in the world,\u201d and stressed that at the turning point of a new century, the two countries, both influential powers, bear a common responsibility for world peace and development. \u201cThe improvement of Sino-US relations are not only in the peoples of both countries, but also conducive to peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region as well as in the whole world,\u201d he said.\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army Daily (Li Shijia, \u201cZHANG WANNIAN MEETS WITH CHAIRMAN OF US JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF,\u201d Beijing, 11/04/00, P1), (Li Mingjiang, \u201cCHI HAOTIAN MEETS WITH CHAIRMAN OF US JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF,\u201d Beijing, 11/04/00, P1), (\u201cFU QUANYOU MEETS WITH CHAIRMAN OF US JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF,\u201d Beijing, 11/04/00, P1) and China Daily (Hu Qihua, \u201cUS MILITARY LEADER BACKS ONE-CHINA POLICY,\u201d 11/4/00, P1) reported that Vice Chairman of PRC Central Military Commission Zhang Wannian, PRC Defense Minister Chi Haotian and Chief of General Staff of PLA Fu Quanyou met respectively with Chairman of US Joint Chiefs of Staff Henry Hugh Shelton. Shelton said that his country will abide by the one-China principle in handling the Taiwan question. He expressed his hope that stable relations would be established to avoid misunderstandings. The development of \u201ccontinuous and constructive\u201d relations between the US and the PRC are not only in the interests of the two countries, but would also improve peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, Shelton said. Fu echoed the importance of PRC-US relations. On the issue of military exchanges between the two countries, Fu said that the resumption of contact earlier this year is a sound move that the PRC is willing to maintain. However, he pointed out that an increase in US arms sales to Taiwan not only \u201cgave the wrong signals\u201d to Taiwan, but also has a negative impact on cross-Straits relations and the stability of Sino-US relations. He said that Chinese people wanted peace, but added there is no room for compromise on the question of territorial integrity. The PLA does not rule out the use of force over the Taiwan question. Chi Haotian said that the new leader in Taiwan has evaded and blurred the one-China policy, adding that such conduct seriously damaged the possibility of peaceful reunification.\nChina Daily (\u201cFIRST JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES UNDER WAY,\u201d Tokyo, 11/03/00, P12) reported that the Japanese Defense Agency official said that Japan and the US began their first joint military exercises on Thursday in line with the adoption of new security arrangements last year. The New Defense Guidelines drawn up by the two countries in August 1999 authorize Japan to provide logistical support to the US military in the event of an emergency in the region. Over 21,000 soldiers and 310 jets will participate in the exercises at land facilities run by Japan\u2019s Self- Defense Forces, as well as in Japanese territorial waters and airspace. The agency official said that the exercises, which will last for 17 days, are aimed simply at better preparing for a possible invasion of Japan, and were not targeted at any specific country. US Forces in Japan spokesperson Master Sergent Eudith Rodney said that the joint maneuvers are intended to \u201cincrease the defensive readiness\u201d of Japan\u2019s Self- Defense Forces and US military personnel. Naval forces from the two countries will simulate picking up pilots of downed US warplanes off Japan\u2019s east and west coasts.\nContemporary Asia-Pacific Studies (Xu Wansheng, \u201cJAPAN-U.S. ALLIANCE RELATIONS AFTER COLD WAR: THREE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL TENDENCIES,\u201d No. 10, 2000) published an article on the future development of Japan-US relations. The writer noted that after the end of the Cold War, when Japan and the US are seeking to establish alliance relationship on a global scale, the unsymmetrical characteristics existing in bilateral relations is being adjusted. However, the potential development of conflicts between Japan and US are inevitable and insurmountable. Three features\u2014global scale, symmetry and conflict, frame the Japan-US relations. Xu compared policies and actions of the two countries after the end of the Cold War to the motives and forms of Japan-US alliance during the Cold War, commenting that, in the new era, Japan and US have wider common interests and share similar values and ideology. While both emphasize the new global scale of their bilateral relations, Japan is driven by the idea of improving its political significance in the international community by allying with the US, while the US, still guided by the idea of leading the world, needs Japan due to its own relatively decline of economic capability. This in turn plays a restraining role on Japan\u2019s remilitarization. When shifting focus to diplomatic practice, Xu said, Japan and US have generally maintained a collaborative paradigm. On the symmetrical relationship issue, he argued that in the Cold War, Japan-US relations are extremely asymmetrical. However, with the development of Japan\u2019s economy, the voices for equal partnership in Japan increases. Since the end of the Cold War, Japan has become more strategically important to US leadership in its Pacific wing, which is fully expressed in the revised guidelines. The writer predicted that as long as Japan keeps its economic growth, it is only a matter of time to break the Japan-US asymmetrical relations. Being the most sophisticated of bilateral relations, Japan and US can not avoid the potential increase of conflict. Superficially speaking, conflict lies in trade disputes. The in-depth conflict is strategic. Japan has never given up its dream and struggle for political significance, and Japan is seeking to be independent in international affairs, which will inevitably confront US leadership.\nChina Daily (Hu Qihua, \u201cCOUNTRIES CALLED ON TO COMPLY WITH MISSILE SYSTEM TREATY,\u201d 11/03/00, P1) reported that PRC Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhu Bangzao on Thursday urged the international community to strictly observe the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. The First Committee of the UN adopted a resolution\u2013proposed by Belarus, the PRC, Russia, and Kyrgyzstan\u2013on Wednesday calling for united efforts to strengthen the ABM Treaty. Zhu argued that the passing of the resolution reflected the will and determination of the international community to maintain global balance and stability. Zhu reiterated that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, criticizing the US proposal to include Taiwan in Theater Missile Defense (TMD), which he said will severely violate China\u2019s plans for reunification. He said that developing NMD and the TMD was \u201ccontrary to the trend of the times\u201d and \u201cnot conducive to international efforts on disarmament and arms control,\u201d adding that the PRC hopes that the US will give them up at an early date.\nChina Daily (Hu Qihua, \u201cCOUNTRIES CALLED ON TO COMPLY WITH MISSILE SYSTEM TREATY,\u201d 11/03/00, P1) reported that PRC Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhu Bangzao said on November 2 that the US election is an internal affair of the US, and China \u201cwill not interfere.\u201d He said that the PRC hopes that friendly relations and cooperation between PRC and US will continue to develop. Zhu pointed out that the PRC has taken note that both candidates said that they attach great importance to the development of relations with PRC. He had no comment on the election itself.\nWrite a 500-word creative story:", "completion_only": "", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 102, "avg_token_entropy": 3.2098052501678467, "avg_token_perplexity": 24.774260971578403, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

He looked down at his watch, 6:59pm. Then he got up and started walking quickly down the street. The man in the suit followed him, trying to keep up with his fast pace. As they were walking, they passed by a shop window. The man noticed something unusual about the reflection. He stopped and looked at the mirror. It was a big, beautiful, shiny mirror. He tried to get a better look at it, but couldn't see anything because he didn't have enough time. Then he continued walking.\n\nAs soon as he had walked a few blocks, he realized that the man in the suit had disappeared. He started walking faster, trying to catch up with him. After some time, he saw the man in the suit again. This time, he was standing near the entrance of a restaurant. The man in the suit was looking around nervously. The man in the suit approached him and said, \u201cI'm sorry for following you. I didn't mean to scare you.\u201d The other man replied, \u201cIt's okay, I didn't know anyone could see me.\u201d They both smiled and shook hands.\n\nThis story illustrates how easy it is to get lost in our own thoughts and feelings when we're walking alone. We often forget about those moments and focus on the negative side. However, sometimes, if we take a moment to appreciate the beauty around us, we might find something special. And sometimes, even if we don't notice it, someone else might.\n\nAnother example:\n\nA woman was sitting on a bench, watching children play.

Use a strong ending that shows how it makes them feel.\n\nUseful language:\n\n- It was the first time I had ever been away from home\n- I miss all my friends\n- Everything is different here\n- We get along fine most of the time\n- It's hard to get used to things like this\n- I feel like I don't fit in\n- I think it will be good for us to try something new\n\nSuggested Solution:\n\n\nHe was sitting on the bench when suddenly a man in a suit approached him. He looked down at his watch, 6:59pm. Then he got up and started walking quickly down the street. The man in the suit followed him, trying to keep up with his fast pace. As they were walking, they passed by a shop window. The man noticed something unusual about the reflection. He stopped and looked at the mirror. It was a big, beautiful, shiny mirror. He tried to get a better look at it, but couldn't see anything because he didn't have enough time. Then he continued walking.\n\nAs soon as he had walked a few blocks, he realized that the man in the suit had disappeared. He started walking faster, trying to catch up with him. After some time, he saw the man in the suit again. This time, he was standing near the entrance of a restaurant. The man in the suit was looking around nervously. The man in the suit approached him and said, \u201cI'm sorry for following you. I didn't mean to scare you.\u201d The other man replied, \u201cIt's okay, I didn't know anyone could see me.\u201d They both smiled and shook hands.\n\nThis story illustrates how easy it is to get lost in our own thoughts and feelings when we're walking alone. We often forget about those moments and focus on the negative side. However, sometimes, if we take a moment to appreciate the beauty around us, we might find something special. And sometimes, even if we don't notice it, someone else might.\n\nAnother example:\n\nA woman was sitting on a bench, watching children play.

This can help you price your treasure. Look online at how similar items are being priced, and make sure you don't undervalue or overvalue your item.\n  7. 7\n    Decide how you want to market your piece. Do you have a garage sale planned? Is there a local auction you can attend? Are you planning on posting your piece on eBay?\n    \u2022 Before going through with any sale, make sure it is legal to sell.

People are born with two goals to achieve short-term and long-term objectives. People have their individual plans for short term goals. For example, you may save some amount for the short term objective and you may plan to get a job in the near future for the same amount of saving. Some people might save for their future education and marriage in short term. On the other hand, people with long term goals may save for their retirement, children education or to plan a trip abroad.\n\nHow can a short term and long term plan be helpful? It is always a best practice to plan for short term goals which can be achieved in the next one or two years. Short term goal can be achieved if it includes some hard work and discipline. Long term goals are those which can be achieved over several years. You must have patience, consistency and determination for the long-term goals. People who want to achieve more than just one goal may try to combine these goals and may try to work harder. They may try to save more and may go for a job which can provide more salary and then save it for their long term goals.\n\nWhat should be included in short and long term goals? Most people want to increase their savings for the long term objectives, but you must have a balanced approach. If you want to save for your retirement, then you must make sure you are not spending unnecessarily. Some people want to save for their children's education or marriage, but it is also important to plan a trip for fun. If you don't have any family goals, then you must work hard to fulfil your own interests and dreams. If you want to save for the car or to buy some other things, then it is recommended that you must make a list of all those things you want to achieve and then divide them into short term or long term goals. Your short term goals are achieved if you start saving more for your interests, dreams and goals. You can easily save money for your retirement plan through disciplined saving.\n\nYou can also create your long term plan for the goals.

Jesse Eisenberg and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd commit fully as cousins hell-bent on getting rich in the stock market by building a super-fast cross-country fibre-optic cable \u2014 a quest that proves more challenging for them and far wonkier for the audience than initially expected. And yet, writer-director Kim Nguyen\u2019s faith in his weird, cynical vision proves sufficiently compelling, even when the characters\u2019 peculiarities turn tiresome.\nPremiering at the Toronto Film Festival, the movie will benefit from the star power of Eisenberg and Skarsg\u00e5rd, not to mention a villainous turn from Salma Hayek. Hummingbird\u2019s juggling of genres \u2014 thriller, heist movie, family drama, character study, social commentary \u2014 may attract adventurous viewers, although it could prove challenging to marketers trying to condense the film into a poster.\nEisenberg plays Vincent, who convinces his computer-savvy cousin Anton (Skarsg\u00e5rd) that they should quit their jobs at a high-powered New York trading company, run by Eva Torres (Hayek), to go into business for themselves. Their plan: construct a thin but reliable cable that runs from Kansas to New Jersey that can receive trading information milliseconds faster than the competition, allowing them and their clients to make millions.\nFor those not familiar with high-frequency trading or other aspects of the stock market, Hummingbird refuses to simplify its characters\u2019 milieu. But the strategy pays off for Nguyen (War Witch), who in some ways wants Vincent and Anton\u2019s plan to be abstruse, underlining how in our modern age untold fortunes can be acquired simply by accessing data a millisecond faster. There\u2019s an unreality to their scheme \u2014 just random numbers on a computer screen \u2014 that speaks to the cold efficiency of the operation.\nFurther highlighting the joylessness of their ambition is a series of bizarre obstacles that cross their paths, including nervous investors, obstinate land owners who don\u2019t want cable laid under their property, problems with Anton\u2019s computations to shave a single millisecond off their system\u2019s data speed, and an unexpected serious illness. And that\u2019s not even accounting for Eva, who fights back by devising a counter-strategy that will potentially render their new cable obsolete.\nIn films like The Social Network, Eisenberg has depicted driven, not wholly likable protagonists, and so his work as Vincent may not feel that far removed from past portrayals. But as Hummingbird rolls along, the depth of Vincent\u2019s relentless ambition becomes starker, and the Oscar-nominated actor unapologetically reveals his character\u2019s every desperate, devious tendency, resulting in a brazen performance that willingly strains credibility. And yet, Eisenberg\u2019s tight jaw and dark eyes communicate all the hidden reasons why he needs this plan to work.\nIf anything, Skarsg\u00e5rd is even more over-the-top as a socially awkward programmer who has spent most of his life being browbeaten by his cousin. Anton\u2019s objectives seem less materialistic than Vincent\u2019s \u2014 he just wants to design a superior product \u2014 but although Anton\u2019s quirky behaviour can feel invented rather than organic, Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s vulnerability elicits our sympathy.\nHayek has a blast as Hummingbird\u2019s antagonist, pumping as much life into Eva\u2019s cartoon-y lines as she can. Like Vincent and Anton, she operates in a world in which millions of dollars are at stake \u2014 although everything is so theoretical that those unseen fortunes could simply be a figment of their imagination. As the double-crosses and twists unspool, Nguyen very consciously seems to be commenting on the ugliness that emerges in people when money is on the line. The Hummingbird Project teaches that old lesson in a strange, new (and mostly satisfying) way.\n", "prompt": "A defiantly odd thriller involving esoteric subject matter, The Hummingbird Project tells a familiar story of ambition and greed with enough eccentricity that the movie\u2019s strangeness becomes one of its chief attributes.

Hummingbird\u2019s juggling of genres \u2014 thriller, heist movie, family drama, character study, social commentary \u2014 may attract adventurous viewers, although it could prove challenging to marketers trying to condense the film into a poster.\nEisenberg plays Vincent, who convinces his computer-savvy cousin Anton (Skarsg\u00e5rd) that they should quit their jobs at a high-powered New York trading company, run by Eva Torres (Hayek), to go into business for themselves. Their plan: construct a thin but reliable cable that runs from Kansas to New Jersey that can receive trading information milliseconds faster than the competition, allowing them and their clients to make millions.\nFor those not familiar with high-frequency trading or other aspects of the stock market, Hummingbird refuses to simplify its characters\u2019 milieu. But the strategy pays off for Nguyen (War Witch), who in some ways wants Vincent and Anton\u2019s plan to be abstruse, underlining how in our modern age untold fortunes can be acquired simply by accessing data a millisecond faster. There\u2019s an unreality to their scheme \u2014 just random numbers on a computer screen \u2014 that speaks to the cold efficiency of the operation.\nFurther highlighting the joylessness of their ambition is a series of bizarre obstacles that cross their paths, including nervous investors, obstinate land owners who don\u2019t want cable laid under their property, problems with Anton\u2019s computations to shave a single millisecond off their system\u2019s data speed, and an unexpected serious illness. And that\u2019s not even accounting for Eva, who fights back by devising a counter-strategy that will potentially render their new cable obsolete.\nIn films like The Social Network, Eisenberg has depicted driven, not wholly likable protagonists, and so his work as Vincent may not feel that far removed from past portrayals. But as Hummingbird rolls along, the depth of Vincent\u2019s relentless ambition becomes starker, and the Oscar-nominated actor unapologetically reveals his character\u2019s every desperate, devious tendency, resulting in a brazen performance that willingly strains credibility. And yet, Eisenberg\u2019s tight jaw and dark eyes communicate all the hidden reasons why he needs this plan to work.\nIf anything, Skarsg\u00e5rd is even more over-the-top as a socially awkward programmer who has spent most of his life being browbeaten by his cousin. Anton\u2019s objectives seem less materialistic than Vincent\u2019s \u2014 he just wants to design a superior product \u2014 but although Anton\u2019s quirky behaviour can feel invented rather than organic, Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s vulnerability elicits our sympathy.\nHayek has a blast as Hummingbird\u2019s antagonist, pumping as much life into Eva\u2019s cartoon-y lines as she can. Like Vincent and Anton, she operates in a world in which millions of dollars are at stake \u2014 although everything is so theoretical that those unseen fortunes could simply be a figment of their imagination. As the double-crosses and twists unspool, Nguyen very consciously seems to be commenting on the ugliness that emerges in people when money is on the line.

Walk up to the old man and speak to him. What does he tell you? 2. Imagine you are a girl called Helen. One day you visit a friend in hospital. The doctor tells you that your friend is ill. What is the illness and how do you know your friend is ill? 3. Imagine you are a policeman or policewoman. You receive a call from a taxi driver who says he is being threatened by three men in a pub. What are the three men doing and what do you do when you arrive in the pub?\n\nThe best way to think of a plot is as a question and an answer. The question is the conflict or tension in the story. What happens to make the character sad? What will happen to make him happy again? A plot needs a character, a setting, and a problem. It also needs to have a beginning, middle, and end. The best plots are interesting and make the reader want to know what will happen next.\n\nA plot consists of three phases. These are: the exposition (which is the introduction, or setting of the scene), the development (where something happens to change the original state of affairs), and the resolution (where the conflict or problem is resolved). These three phases should be written in that order. However, the first phase should be the last phase that you write because you need the middle phase(s) to plan the other two.\n\nThere are many kinds of plots. These include action, adventure, mystery, or romantic plots. The type of plot you choose depends on what type of story you are writing. If you are writing a story about someone's feelings, then you will choose a romantic plot. If you are writing a detective story, then you will choose a mystery plot. An action plot is based around action (i.e. the main character is in danger and must try to escape), and an adventure plot is based around travelling and meeting new people and having new experiences.\n\nThe most important thing to remember when you are writing your story is to write in your own words. That way, the reader will be able to tell what kind of person you are and what you believe in. You can do this by using words that have a certain meaning to you, or by using lots of adjectives and similes to describe things", "completion_only": "1. Imagine you are a young man named Peter.

{"random_doc_file_path": "/home/eisape/projects/diversify_lm_output/dolma/data/v1_5r2_sample-0036.json.gz", "random_doc": "Some employers and employees mistakenly believe that the provision of a new Employee Handbook and a signed acknowledgement form is akin to a new employee-employer contract or agreement. This has proven not to be the case in multiple court cases. Providing an employee handbook to your existing employees usually lacks the contract law \u201cbasics\u201d of offer/acceptance, consideration, and intention. Employers should realize that for the most part, employee handbooks are not enforceable in the same manner as an employment contract. See this First Reference article about handbook enforceability.\nSome employers will write and attach the employee handbook into the employment contract for new employees. This would be an example of an employee handbook with a better chance of being enforced \u2013 but employer beware, this would not extend to any updates to the handbook.\nStatements like this help the employee and the employer use the handbook for its proper purposes rather than as a substitute for clearly written and enforceable employment contracts.\nHave you seen or read your organizations operation manual or policy and procedure manual? Depending on the organization, these are massive, detailed, regulatory, legal and procedural virtual encyclopedias of every aspect of your organization.\nOrganizations need these detailed policies and procedures to guide the organization in consistent and compliant practices specific to the organization, the industry and regulatory requirements. The policy and procedure manual (sometimes also called an operations manual) functions as a tool for managers and supervisors and usually provides a reference to any regulatory requirements. The operations manual should be located in an accessible location or on the company intranet. All employees (or at a minimum managers and supervisors) should have access to this document \u2013 but it is not a document that all employees will read.

Some of them have an idea about their budget, some don\u2019t. The cash majority of times doesn\u2019t match their work usage. This is a very short post on how this and the ever so changing and obsolete computer technology also puts us in a quandry over the same.\nIn the nov of 2017, I paid a total of 30,000/- for a pc configuration of a Core I 5 7th gen processor, Gigabyte motherboard capable of holding a Nvidia GTX 1030 graphics card and a 64 bit Windows 10. The ram was a 4 gb from corsair and also came a ATX cabinet and SMPS by iball. The ram could be expanded later on . I already had a monitor, a seagate internal hdd and a sony dvd writer. Graphics card was due to the future use of processing DSLR photos on lightroom ( which already took 4 gb ram as standard use). In late 2019, when I finally decided to use lightroom I had to upgrade the ram to 8 gb (which costed me some money via exchange) so that I don\u2019t face any type of stutter. So you see that the configuration is more than enough and powerful for simple use and wont require any major upgrades for many years to come unless either of the processor or the motherboard conks out.\nCompare this to June 2020 when I had to go to the computer market to get the price for an assembled pc unit for someone. His configuration includes a Core I 5 9th gen processor, gigabyte motherboard, Nvidia GTX 1030, 8 GB ram, I ball cabinet and SMPS, a 22\u201d Samsung monitor, 1 TB hdd , DVD writer. All this is costing him under 40,000/- .\nSo you can see how fast technology has become obsolete in just 2.5 years where in almost the same price you are getting much technologically advanced configuration, discounting the fact that these are the prices when the computer and its parts have become expensive after budget.\nThis post is a wake up call to all those who contact us to suggest them a configuration of pc or a laptop model.

He was a retired engineer who had worked for NASA for many years and was well-known for his research on space exploration. One day, James received a letter from the government that changed his life forever.\nThe letter read: \"James, we found your Black Box in the wreckage of the spaceship you built. We want to give it back to you for safekeeping.\" James was thrilled. He had been working on the Black Box for years before it went up in space, but it had never returned.\nWhen he got the box, he couldn't believe his eyes. It was completely intact and looked exactly the same as when he had built it. However, he didn't know what it was for. He knew it had something to do with space exploration, but he didn't know what it contained.\nHe took it to a scientist named Dr. Smith who was an expert on space travel. Dr. Smith looked at the Black Box and said, \"This is amazing! I've never seen anything like it before.\"\n\"What do you think is inside?\" asked James.\n\"Well, I don't know, but I'm going to find out,\" said Dr. Smith. He opened the box and inside was a single coin. It looked like any other coin, except for one thing: the words \"space exploration\" were etched into it.\nDr. Smith was shocked. \"How did this get here?\" he asked.\nJames explained, \"I built this coin specifically for the Black Box so that if anyone ever found it, they would know what its purpose was.\"\nDr. Smith was amazed by the fact that the Black Box had been recovered, but even more so by the fact that it contained a coin with words etched into it.\nFrom then on, James became famous around the world for his discovery of the Space Exploration Coin. People would come from all over to see the coin and hear about James' story. And now, whenever anyone hears about the Black Box, they automatically think about the Space Exploration Coin and everything that it represents.\nThe End\n\nWrite a 1.2.3 or 4.2.3 sentence to introduce a character.\n\n  \u2022 1.

If an identity thief applies for credit using your children\u2019s information, the lender will get a response indicating no credit report exists with those identifiers, and also may receive an alert that the Social Security number belongs to a minor.\nThat being said, I'm not a minor - and I don't see any reason why a thief couldn't apply for credit just because I don't have a current credit report.\nSome states now require that a credit report be created if none exists in order to add a credit freeze.\nHowever, I have not been able to find any requirement for that in my state's credit laws.\nPlacing a freeze on your credit report will prevent lenders and others from accessing your Credit Report entirely, which will prevent them from extending credit.

The man was very ugly, with one big black tooth. He had dark red hair and his clothes were not very clean.\nThe boys were curious and asked the man \u201cwhat are you doing in this little shop?\u201d.\n\u201cOh I am selling rare gems! said the old man\u201d.\nThe boys didn\u2019t believe the man but wanted to have a look, so they asked the man to show them the gems. The man took a gem from a box and put it under David\u2019s nose. \u201cCan you smell any flowers?\u201d he asked. David was amazed and said \u201cYes, it smells of roses\u201d. The man continued to show the boys 10 gems, 5 for Steven and 5 for David. David\u2019s gems smelled of violets, gerberas and a few other flowers, as well as Steven\u2019s gems. The man asked David and Steven to guess how many gem\u2019s they had. Both boys looked at each other and said \u201c15\u201d.\nDavid and Steven ran home with their gems and David said to Steven \u201cI think we should keep these gems hidden, we don\u2019t know who this old man is\u201d.

Iteration count limit is arbitrary, with a finite limit some pixels will always be classified as \"unknown\".\" Claude Heiland-Allen\nPseudocode.\nPseudocode by Claude Heiland-Allen\nAnalysis of code from BOF.\n\"The Beauty of Fractals\" gives an almost correct computer program for the distance estimation shown in the right image. A possible reason that that method did not gain ground is that the procedure in this program is seriously flawed: The calculation of formula_8 is performed (and completed) before the calculation of formula_9, and not after as it ought to be (formula_10 uses formula_8, not formula_12). For the successive calculation of formula_9, we must know formula_14 (which in this case is 2formula_8). In order to avoid the calculation of formula_8 (\"k\" = 0, 1, 2, ...) again, this sequence is saved in an array. Using this array, formula_17 is calculated up to the last iteration number, and it is stated that overflow can occur. If overflow occurs the point is regarded as belonging to the boundary (the bail-out condition). If overflow does not occur, the calculation of the distance can be performed. Apart from it being untrue that overflow can occur, the method makes use of an unnecessary storing and repetition of the iteration, making it unnecessarily slower and less attractive. The following remark in the book is nor inviting either: \"It turns out that the images depend very sensitively on the various choices\" (bail-out radius, maximum iteration number, overflow, thickness of the boundary and blow-up factor). Is it this nonsense that has got people to lose all desire for using and generalizing the method? \" Gertbuschmann\nSo :\n\"I'm finally generating DEM (Distance Estimate Method) based images that I'm happy with. It turns out that my code had a couple of bugs in it. The new code runs reasonably fast, even with all the extra math to compute distance estimates.\nThe algorithm in S of F I (\"The Science of Fractal Images\" uses a sharp cut-off from white to black when pixels get close enough to the set, but I find this makes for jagged looking plots. I've implemented a non-linear color gradient that works pretty well.\nFor pixels where their DE value is threshold&gt;=DE&gt;=0, I scale the value of DE to 1&gt;=DE&gt;=0, then do the calculation: gradient_value = 1 - (1-DE)^n, (\"^n\" means to the n power. I wish I could use superscripts!)\n\"n\" is an adjustment factor that lets me change the shape of the gradient curve. The value \"gradient_value\" determines the color of the pixel. If it's 0, the pixel is colored at the starting color (white, for a B&amp;W plot.) If \"gradient_value\" is 1, the pixel gets the end color (e.g.\nblack) For values of n&gt;1, this gives a rapid change in color for pixels that are far from the set, and a slower change in value as DE approaches 0. For values of n&lt;1, it gives a slow color change for pixels far from the set, and rapid change close to the set. For n=1, I get a linear\ncolor gradient. The non-linear gradient lets me use the DE value to anti-alias my plots. By adjusting my threshold value and my adjustment value, I can get good looking results for a variety of images.\" Duncan C \n\"All our DE formulas above are only approximations \u2013 valid in the limit n\u2192\u221e, and some also only for point close to the fractal boundary. This becomes very apparent when you start rendering these structures \u2013 you will often encounter noise and artifacts.\nMultiplying the DE estimates by a number smaller than 1, may be used to reduce noise (this is the Fudge Factor in Fragmentarium).\nAnother common approach is to oversample \u2013 or render images at large sizes and downscale.\" Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen \nExample code.\nTwo algorithm in two loops.\nHere is Java function.

A possible reason that that method did not gain ground is that the procedure in this program is seriously flawed: The calculation of formula_8 is performed (and completed) before the calculation of formula_9, and not after as it ought to be (formula_10 uses formula_8, not formula_12). For the successive calculation of formula_9, we must know formula_14 (which in this case is 2formula_8). In order to avoid the calculation of formula_8 (\"k\" = 0, 1, 2, ...) again, this sequence is saved in an array. Using this array, formula_17 is calculated up to the last iteration number, and it is stated that overflow can occur. If overflow occurs the point is regarded as belonging to the boundary (the bail-out condition). If overflow does not occur, the calculation of the distance can be performed. Apart from it being untrue that overflow can occur, the method makes use of an unnecessary storing and repetition of the iteration, making it unnecessarily slower and less attractive. The following remark in the book is nor inviting either: \"It turns out that the images depend very sensitively on the various choices\" (bail-out radius, maximum iteration number, overflow, thickness of the boundary and blow-up factor). Is it this nonsense that has got people to lose all desire for using and generalizing the method? \" Gertbuschmann\nSo :\n\"I'm finally generating DEM (Distance Estimate Method) based images that I'm happy with. It turns out that my code had a couple of bugs in it. The new code runs reasonably fast, even with all the extra math to compute distance estimates.\nThe algorithm in S of F I (\"The Science of Fractal Images\" uses a sharp cut-off from white to black when pixels get close enough to the set, but I find this makes for jagged looking plots. I've implemented a non-linear color gradient that works pretty well.\nFor pixels where their DE value is threshold&gt;=DE&gt;=0, I scale the value of DE to 1&gt;=DE&gt;=0, then do the calculation: gradient_value = 1 - (1-DE)^n, (\"^n\" means to the n power. I wish I could use superscripts!)\n\"n\" is an adjustment factor that lets me change the shape of the gradient curve. The value \"gradient_value\" determines the color of the pixel. If it's 0, the pixel is colored at the starting color (white, for a B&amp;W plot.) If \"gradient_value\" is 1, the pixel gets the end color (e.g.\nblack) For values of n&gt;1, this gives a rapid change in color for pixels that are far from the set, and a slower change in value as DE approaches 0. For values of n&lt;1, it gives a slow color change for pixels far from the set, and rapid change close to the set. For n=1, I get a linear\ncolor gradient. The non-linear gradient lets me use the DE value to anti-alias my plots. By adjusting my threshold value and my adjustment value, I can get good looking results for a variety of images.\" Duncan C \n\"All our DE formulas above are only approximations \u2013 valid in the limit n\u2192\u221e, and some also only for point close to the fractal boundary. This becomes very apparent when you start rendering these structures \u2013 you will often encounter noise and artifacts.\nMultiplying the DE estimates by a number smaller than 1, may be used to reduce noise (this is the Fudge Factor in Fragmentarium).\nAnother common approach is to oversample \u2013 or render images at large sizes and downscale.\" Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen \nExample code.\nTwo algorithm in two loops.\nHere is Java function.

In such case, the distance is overestimated, i.e., the reported radius could contain points outside the Mandelbrot set.\nFor interior distance estimation, you need the period, then a number (maybe 10 or so should usually be enough) Newton steps to find the limit cycle.\nOptimisation.\n=References=\nWrite a 500-word creative story: 05:04:20:4d:1:2:35:8:5:90:54:5:0:5:74:74:70:70:40:65:78:71:1:1:2:4:4:69:5:8:74:5:4:69:70:67:69:20:67:5:6:6:69:69:65:6:6:6:6:6:6:65:6:6:5:72:72:20:6:5:6:69:20:4:76:76:6:72:5:76:5:4:76:76:72:71:67:20:71:70:74:76:76:20:6:72:20:6:6:20:4:5:20:6:70:71:72:70:6:6:67:2:5:6:6:6:68:20:20:6:6:68:6:70:4:4:76:74:70:20:70:72:5:20:70:65:5:70:6:70:6:7:6:70:65:68:70:72:4:6:4:6:74:6:71:70:6:20:66:6:6:70:67:68:6:6:6:4:5:6:68:6:65:6:65:6:65:66:6:6:20:4:6:6:4:6:70:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:68:6:6:6:6:6:68:6:6:6:68:6:6:67:6:6:6:6:6:67:6:6:6:6:6:66:68:6:6:6:6:6:6:66:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:67:67:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:", "completion_only": "05:04:20:4d:1:2:35:8:5:90:54:5:0:5:74:74:70:70:40:65:78:71:1:1:2:4:4:69:5:8:74:5:4:69:70:67:69:20:67:5:6:6:69:69:65:6:6:6:6:6:6:65:6:6:5:72:72:20:6:5:6:69:20:4:76:76:6:72:5:76:5:4:76:76:72:71:67:20:71:70:74:76:76:20:6:72:20:6:6:20:4:5:20:6:70:71:72:70:6:6:67:2:5:6:6:6:68:20:20:6:6:68:6:70:4:4:76:74:70:20:70:72:5:20:70:65:5:70:6:70:6:7:6:70:65:68:70:72:4:6:4:6:74:6:71:70:6:20:66:6:6:70:67:68:6:6:6:4:5:6:68:6:65:6:65:6:65:66:6:6:20:4:6:6:4:6:70:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:68:6:6:6:6:6:68:6:6:6:68:6:6:67:6:6:6:6:6:67:6:6:6:6:6:66:68:6:6:6:6:6:6:66:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:67:67:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:6:", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 156, "avg_token_entropy": 1.0937558161169294, "avg_token_perplexity": 6.130040950586502, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

This includes features like whether the song is in a major or minor key, the liveness, the instrumentalness, the danceability, and many others. One option to work with these songs would be to get them all at once via a playlist that Tom Mock made.\nThis would be perfect for exploring the audio features on their own. On the other hand, this is going to be pretty difficult to match up to the songs in the rankings dataset because both the titles and artists are significantly different, so let\u2019s take a different approach. Let\u2019s create a little function to find the Spotify track identifier via search_spotify() (Spotify has already handled search pretty well) and use purrr::map() to apply it to all the songs we have in our dataset.\nAt the end of that, there are 6% of songs that I failed to find a Spotify track identifier for. Not too bad!\nNow that we have the track identifiers, we can get the audio features. The function get_track_audio_features() can only take 100 tracks at most at once, so let\u2019s divide up our tracks into smaller chunks and then map() through them.\nWe have audio features! \ud83c\udf89 Now let\u2019s put that together with the rankings and create a dataframe for modeling.\nHow are these quantities correlated with each other?\nLouder songs have higher energy, and older songs tend to be more danceable and have higher valence (i.e. be more \u201chappy\u201d).\nLet\u2019s train a linear model on these audio features.\nWe only have evidence for year being important in the critic ratings from this model. We know that some of the features are at least a bit correlated, though, so let\u2019s use PCA.\nWe can use the recipes package to implement PCA in tidymodels.\n## Training data contained 293 data points and no missing data.\nLet\u2019s walk through the steps in this recipe.\nFirst, we must tell the recipe() what our model is going to be (using a formula here) and what data we are using.\nNext, we update the role for title and artist, since these are variables we want to keep around for convenience as identifiers for rows but are not a predictor or outcome.\nNext, we take the log of the outcome (points, the critic ratings).\nWe need to center and scale the numeric predictors, because we are about to implement PCA.\nFinally, we use step_pca() for the actual principal component analysis.\nBefore using prep() these steps have been defined but not actually run or implemented. The prep() function is where everything gets evaluated.\nOnce we have that done, we can both explore the results of the PCA and then eventually use it in a model. Let\u2019s start with checking out how the PCA turned out. We can tidy() any of our recipe steps, including the PCA step, which is the third step.

They make it a lot easier to communicate with my family at dinner without interrupting the whole table, so my mom won\u2019t get upset if I try to order some dessert or something. And because they\u2019re so compact and easy to integrate into any electronics project, I thought it would be cool to make a similar gadget that\u2019s activated by pushing on a piezo buzzer. That way, I could tell the world about my latest project without having to talk about it directly!\nThe problem: The problem is that piezo buzzers are very quiet and hard to detect, especially when you\u2019re in a crowd.\nSolution: But what if you had a way to amplify the sound? What if there was a way to make it so that touching the buzzer makes it really loud, so that you can get your point across to everyone who\u2019s listening? That\u2019s exactly what this gadget does.\nIn order to get it working, you will need two parts: A mini speaker (you can buy one online for around $15) and a small button (also available online for about $5). The mini speaker is connected to the positive output of the Arduino, and the button is connected to the ground pin. When you press on the button, the Arduino plays a high frequency tone through the speaker, which makes it really loud and easy to hear.\nThe solution is very simple. You can buy a small piezo buzzer online for about $5, and it is very compact and easy to integrate into any electronics project. You can get the mini speaker and button here and here respectively. In order to get the Arduino code up and running, follow the instructions below.\nYou\u2019ll need to download the latest version of the Arduino IDE software from the Arduino website. Once you have installed it, connect your piezo buzzer (or button) to the Arduino using the red and black cables that come with the piezo buzzer (or button). Connect the mini speaker to the positive output of the Arduino and the button to ground. Then open up the Arduino code below and upload it to your board. When you run the code, you should hear a loud tone come out of the speaker when you press on the button. That\u2019s it!

The only way that he can save him was by going to the bottom of the waterfall and pulling the boy out from the water.\n\nTommy was very determined to save the boys life because he didn't want anyone to die. It was then that Tommy saw the boy fall to the bottom of the waterfalls. Tommy swam to the boy who had already fainted and pulled the boy to the top of the cliff. Tommy had saved the boys life and from then on they would always be friends.\n\nWhat\u2019s the worst thing that ever happened to you at work?

I think the one we made as a family has been used the most in the last 24 hours by me, my daughter and my husband so I think it is a great present too.

The pieces come together really easily and is a great starter project if you don't already have the skills to make a puppet. I have only had 24 hours to play with my new toy but it has been used quite a bit and it is still in perfect condition.

I was taking care of the kitchen, and I heard my daughter say, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for summer to come.\u201d I immediately thought of how I could help her with that. \u201cYou can start by packing your school lunches now,\u201d I said. \u201cThat way when school starts next week, you won\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nShe looked at me with an innocent smile and nodded, \u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d I chuckled to myself, knowing how much she loves to cook and eat healthy. I also thought about how this would be good practice for her before she goes off to college in two years. It\u2019s never too early to learn life skills!\n\nJust then, my husband walked into the room with our little boy. He was so excited to see his sister, he ran straight to her chair and gave her a hug. His eyes were wide open with excitement and curiosity. \u201cWhat are you making today?\u201d He asked. \u201cChicken salad,\u201d she answered proudly. Her face lit up when she saw her brother\u2019s enthusiasm for learning new things. \u201cYou can learn how to make a salad, too!\u201d She suggested.\n\nWe all laughed, but deep down inside, we knew she was right.

I used to think I was the smallest too, but my brother Harry outgrew me soon enough and Dara is not far behind. Tilly, my sweet sister, remains the smallest and she is only a few months older than me. We\u2019re all golden retrievers, and while I think I\u2019m prettier, I know I\u2019m not the smartest. Harry has always been the clever one. I\u2019m not sure what Dara is yet - she still has a lot of growing to do. When Harry was a little older than I am now, he decided he wanted to fly. Tilly and Dara were not really into that. They preferred to run around, playing with their doggy friends. Harry didn\u2019t have many of those and he never seemed to notice. Tilly and Dara always laughed and laughed whenever Harry spoke of his dream. He would tell us all about it. He was going to build a big machine that would let him fly with his arms!

We never saw anyone else with a big machine like the one he was going to make, and we didn\u2019t know anyone else who wanted to fly.

In this lecture, we're gonna talk about the five and most common hormone imbalances experienced by women. Now you may be wondering, what about the guys? We're gonna hold off on this conversation for now because we've got an entire module coming up later about hormone imbalances and conditions specific to men. So for right now, ladies first. Remember, it's not your role as a Health Coach to diagnose. We're teaching you the signs and symptoms so that you can learn how to spot these issues in your clients and refer them for testing to either receive or rule out a diagnosis. All right, with that said, are you ready? The first of the five most common hormone imbalances in women is low progesterone. Low progesterone can mean a couple of things. First, it can mean that a client has overall low production of this hormone, but a person's progesterone levels can be normal and still be considered low relative to estrogen, if their estrogen levels are through the roof. So progesterone is considered normal or low in comparison to how much estrogen a person has. Makes sense? All you need to remember is that it's the ratio of progesterone to estrogen the matters. When this ratio is off, it's often lower progesterone resulting in estrogen dominance. So the question remains, what causes low progesterone? This hormonal imbalance is most commonly due to stress or high cortisol. When the body produces a lot of cortisol, this can result in the mechanism known as Pregnenolone Steal. What happens here is that cortisol steals the show at the expense of progesterone production. Remember, how we said that the master hormone, pregnenolone gets converted into important sex hormones, like progesterone. Well, instead of doing that, it gets used to make even more cortisol in response to chronic stress. To make matters worse, cortisol can actually block progesterone receptors in the body making these receptors less responsive to progesterone. Remember the lock and key mechanism we discussed before? Basically, the lock gets jammed by cortisol, so that progesterone can't get in and open the lock. Way to be selfish, cortisol. Another cause of low progesterone is synthetic estrogens or xenoestrogens. These are manmade chemicals commonly found in cleaning supplies and body care products like soaps and lotions, and even makeup. These chemicals that mimic estrogen in the body causing estrogen dominance and lower the normal levels of progesterone. Plastics, pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides can also contain these creepy chemicals. Here's another big culprit, hormonal birth control. Most notably, the birth control pill or lack of consistent monthly ovulation can contribute to lower progesterone. Hormonal birth control prevents ovulation from occurring each month, lowering progesterone levels. Symptoms of low progesterone include, difficulty getting or staying pregnant. Breakthrough bleeding through the second half of the menstrual cycle. PMS or PMDD. Menstrual migraines. Having menstrual flow. Irregular or more frequent menstrual cycles. Bloating in the abdomen. And swollen and/or painful breasts. This brings us to the flip side of low progesterone which is excess estrogen or estrogen dominance. Estrogen dominance is caused by a number of factors. As I mentioned before, high cortisol lowers progesterone output and blocks progesterone receptors. When progesterone is low, estrogen dominates. Xenoestrogens like, BPA and phthalates mimic estrogen in the body, tricking the body into estrogen dominance. Excess body fat can also contribute to circulating levels of estrogen in the body, making obesity a cause for estrogen dominance as well. Also, excessive consumption of alcohol is associated with excess estrogen. This can result in irregular periods, dysfunction in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Heavy alcohol consumption also has been linked to spontaneous abortions and higher incidences of breast cancer, which leads researchers to believe that alcohol may mediate changes in estrogen levels. Also, alcohol impairs liver function and it's, you know, liver that's responsible for processing and excreting any extra estrogen from the body. This is one reason why it's so important to fully inquire about your clients' alcohol consumption. It can be a touchy subject for some people, especially for heavy drinkers who feel a stigma of shame or judgment around their drinking habits. You know, how a lot of people downplay or lie about their drinking or smoking, or drug habits when they visit their physician. They might feel inclined to do this with you too since you are a Health Professional. This is why it's important that you take the time to build a report and explain to your clients, why they should be totally forthcoming about their drinking. It could be an important clue about what might be going on with their health or hormones. If a client seems to be hesitant to speak about the drinking habits, remind them that you're asking about this information to help them, and you won't judge or lecture them, no matter what they confide in you. Continuing on, symptoms of high estrogen include heavy bleeding, breast tenderness or cysts, PMS, fibroids, endometriosis, menstrual migraines, moodiness, frequent meltdowns, depression or weepiness, mid-cycle or ovulatory pain and brain fog. Next, we have low estrogen. This can have detrimental effects on women's health as well. Low estrogen can be caused by high stress, resulting in high cortisol levels, disordered eating, which puts physiological as well as mental and emotional stress on the body, nutrient deficiencies, due to poor dietary practices or poor absorption, over-exercising, especially in conjunction with calorie restriction, and hormonal birth control, most notably the birth control pill which not only lowers progesterone, but estrogen, too. The low dose hormonal contraceptives are especially to blame because they leave many women in a state of estrogen deficiency. The symptoms of low estrogen include oligomenorrhea. This is a fancy word for sporadic periods. Amenorrhea, which is defined as the absence of menstruation for three or more months, low sex drive, vaginal dryness, painful sex, hot flashes or night sweats, joint pain, dry skin and eyes, depression, melasma, which is a sun damage that presents as brown or gray brown patches on the face, forearms, or neck, and poor cognitive function, most notably poor memory. Next, we'll talk about excess androgens in women. These are the male hormones that women produce that include testosterone and DHEA. These should never be ignored because even the hormones that are mostly associated with men's health can have profound effects on how women feel and how well their bodies perform. Excess androgens in women are commonly caused by high insulin levels, which can cause the ovaries to produce more testosterone, hormonal birth control containing synthetic progestin. These can produce androgen like effects that promotes symptoms like hair loss in women. High cortisol from our old friend stress. Your adrenal glands make about 50% of your total androgens, so when one adrenal hormone is off, the others are affected as well. This creates a domino effect. Excess body fat, which as we discussed before, can cause excess estrogen. This can affect the production and use of androgens in women. Polycystic ovarian syndrome. Androgen Access is a key characteristic in 20% of women suffering from PCOS, and a condition called Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. This is a surprisingly common genetic condition that can be diagnosed with a simple blood test. Androgen excess can cause unstable blood sugar, also known as hypo or hyperglycemia. Infrequent ovulation, menstrual cycles that are longer than 35 days. Ovarian cysts, mid-cycle pain, acne or oily skin, hair growth on the face, hair loss on the head, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. On to the final hormone imbalance. Low Androgens. In the ever-important balance of the endocrine system, it's also necessary to ensure that androgens aren't too low even for women. You can think of androgens as the hormones that give us spice and edge. They are associated with many facets of youth, including a higher sex drive, shiny hair, supple skin, and even the way we present ourselves to the world. Women with lower androgen levels often exhibit decreased confidence and decline in the propensity to take risks in their lives, whether it'd be in a workplace, relationships or other eyes. There are so many reasons why our clients come to us with issues around confidence and risk taking, but this one is so frequently overlooked. I mean, have you ever thought to consider your clients testosterone or DHEA levels when they struggle with confidence and nothing they do seems to help? This is one reason why it's essential to make sure that these hormone levels are optimal. Low androgens can be caused by the birth control pill or other types of hormonal birth control. This is one of the reasons why it's super important to inquire not just, if your clients use birth control, but what kind and how long they've been on it for. Dysfunction in the adrenal glands or the ovaries can also result in low androgen output. Removal of the ovaries, low ovarian function, or ovarian failure all play a role in low androgens. Nearly all of women's androgenic hormones are produced in the adrenals and the ovaries. So it's critical to keep these glands healthy and working optimally. Symptoms of low androgen levels in women include low sex drive, painful sex, less powerful orgasm, low self-confidence, vaginal dryness, decreased muscle mass, and lack of motivation. Okay, now let's bring it all home. As you can see, hormones and hormone imbalances don't exist in a vacuum, with such a complex and delicate system of hormones and glands working together. When one hormone is off, it's pretty likely that there is at least one other hormone imbalance present as well. Think of it as a domino effect. The most common combinations of hormone imbalances in women are high estrogen and low progesterone, high cortisol and low progesterone or low sex hormones in general, and low estrogen and low testosterone. But remember, everyone is different. All of your clients are unique and will come to you with their own unique situations. You'll want to avoid trying to pigeonhole them into a certain condition or rushing towards solutions. An important thing to remember is that if you encounter one of these imbalances when working with a client, other imbalances may exist alongside it. So a recommendation that you might be inclined to make to help one imbalance may not work with the other. Good coaching here doesn't mean memorizing and knowing every little detail about every hormone in the body. It involves being a good listener, a curious learner, and a creative problem-solver. Just take the time to really explore all possible scenarios to ensure that you capture everything that might be going on. And don't be afraid to tell client that you don't know the answer to something or that. You need to look something up. It's better to be honest than to jump to conclusions or provide misinformation. Just let them know that you look into it and get back to them before the next session. I've enjoyed talking with you today about these common hormonal imbalances and how they affect women's bodies. To recap the five most common female hormone imbalances are high estrogen, low estrogen, low progesterone, excess androgens, and low androgens. Often, when one hormone gets out of balance, it effects at least one other, since they're all so intricately tied together in the body. To get to the root of your client's concerns, take time to listen fully and explore all avenues. To help this information sink in, be sure to check out the handout in your learning center called Signs and Symptoms of Common Hormone Imbalances. Using what you've learned, we encourage you to take some time with your clients this week or even with yourself, or a loved one to start to notice signs and symptoms. Don't diagnose, keep these observations to yourself, just inquire gently about what they're experiencing and begin to correlate these symptoms with possible hormone imbalances. Then, be sure to head on over to the Facebook group to share your findings. Later on in this course, we'll be diving even deeper into the inner workings of the endocrine system and how you can help your clients to balance their hormones with diet and lifestyle. So remember, if you don't feel like you understand all of these concepts, don't worry, because there's more to come. Thanks for watching and I'll see you soon.", "prompt": ">> Hey, welcome back.

Amenorrhea, which is defined as the absence of menstruation for three or more months, low sex drive, vaginal dryness, painful sex, hot flashes or night sweats, joint pain, dry skin and eyes, depression, melasma, which is a sun damage that presents as brown or gray brown patches on the face, forearms, or neck, and poor cognitive function, most notably poor memory. Next, we'll talk about excess androgens in women. These are the male hormones that women produce that include testosterone and DHEA. These should never be ignored because even the hormones that are mostly associated with men's health can have profound effects on how women feel and how well their bodies perform. Excess androgens in women are commonly caused by high insulin levels, which can cause the ovaries to produce more testosterone, hormonal birth control containing synthetic progestin. These can produce androgen like effects that promotes symptoms like hair loss in women. High cortisol from our old friend stress. Your adrenal glands make about 50% of your total androgens, so when one adrenal hormone is off, the others are affected as well. This creates a domino effect. Excess body fat, which as we discussed before, can cause excess estrogen. This can affect the production and use of androgens in women. Polycystic ovarian syndrome. Androgen Access is a key characteristic in 20% of women suffering from PCOS, and a condition called Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. This is a surprisingly common genetic condition that can be diagnosed with a simple blood test. Androgen excess can cause unstable blood sugar, also known as hypo or hyperglycemia. Infrequent ovulation, menstrual cycles that are longer than 35 days. Ovarian cysts, mid-cycle pain, acne or oily skin, hair growth on the face, hair loss on the head, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. On to the final hormone imbalance. Low Androgens. In the ever-important balance of the endocrine system, it's also necessary to ensure that androgens aren't too low even for women. You can think of androgens as the hormones that give us spice and edge. They are associated with many facets of youth, including a higher sex drive, shiny hair, supple skin, and even the way we present ourselves to the world. Women with lower androgen levels often exhibit decreased confidence and decline in the propensity to take risks in their lives, whether it'd be in a workplace, relationships or other eyes. There are so many reasons why our clients come to us with issues around confidence and risk taking, but this one is so frequently overlooked. I mean, have you ever thought to consider your clients testosterone or DHEA levels when they struggle with confidence and nothing they do seems to help? This is one reason why it's essential to make sure that these hormone levels are optimal. Low androgens can be caused by the birth control pill or other types of hormonal birth control. This is one of the reasons why it's super important to inquire not just, if your clients use birth control, but what kind and how long they've been on it for. Dysfunction in the adrenal glands or the ovaries can also result in low androgen output. Removal of the ovaries, low ovarian function, or ovarian failure all play a role in low androgens. Nearly all of women's androgenic hormones are produced in the adrenals and the ovaries. So it's critical to keep these glands healthy and working optimally. Symptoms of low androgen levels in women include low sex drive, painful sex, less powerful orgasm, low self-confidence, vaginal dryness, decreased muscle mass, and lack of motivation. Okay, now let's bring it all home. As you can see, hormones and hormone imbalances don't exist in a vacuum, with such a complex and delicate system of hormones and glands working together. When one hormone is off, it's pretty likely that there is at least one other hormone imbalance present as well. Think of it as a domino effect. The most common combinations of hormone imbalances in women are high estrogen and low progesterone, high cortisol and low progesterone or low sex hormones in general, and low estrogen and low testosterone. But remember, everyone is different. All of your clients are unique and will come to you with their own unique situations. You'll want to avoid trying to pigeonhole them into a certain condition or rushing towards solutions. An important thing to remember is that if you encounter one of these imbalances when working with a client, other imbalances may exist alongside it. So a recommendation that you might be inclined to make to help one imbalance may not work with the other. Good coaching here doesn't mean memorizing and knowing every little detail about every hormone in the body. It involves being a good listener, a curious learner, and a creative problem-solver. Just take the time to really explore all possible scenarios to ensure that you capture everything that might be going on. And don't be afraid to tell client that you don't know the answer to something or that. You need to look something up. It's better to be honest than to jump to conclusions or provide misinformation. Just let them know that you look into it and get back to them before the next session. I've enjoyed talking with you today about these common hormonal imbalances and how they affect women's bodies. To recap the five most common female hormone imbalances are high estrogen, low estrogen, low progesterone, excess androgens, and low androgens. Often, when one hormone gets out of balance, it effects at least one other, since they're all so intricately tied together in the body. To get to the root of your client's concerns, take time to listen fully and explore all avenues. To help this information sink in, be sure to check out the handout in your learning center called Signs and Symptoms of Common Hormone Imbalances. Using what you've learned, we encourage you to take some time with your clients this week or even with yourself, or a loved one to start to notice signs and symptoms. Don't diagnose, keep these observations to yourself, just inquire gently about what they're experiencing and begin to correlate these symptoms with possible hormone imbalances. Then, be sure to head on over to the Facebook group to share your findings. Later on in this course, we'll be diving even deeper into the inner workings of the endocrine system and how you can help your clients to balance their hormones with diet and lifestyle. So remember, if you don't feel like you understand all of these concepts, don't worry, because there's more to come.

Here\u2019s a roundup and summary of what\u2019s happening of reports from Ellie Mae; ATTOM Data Solutions; Redfin; Radian Inc.; TransUnion; Black Knight; Zillow; and PayNearMe.\nEllie Mae, Pleasanton, Calif., released its monthly Origination Insights Report, showing interest rates on all closed loans continued to decline in April to 3.48 percent, down from 3.65 percent in March. As rates dropped, the percentage of refinances continued to increase, representing 65 percent of closed loans, up from 55 percent in March and 51 percent in February.\nEllie Mae reported time to close all loans increased to 42 days in April, up from 40 days in March. FICO scores on all loans increased to 749 in April, up from 742 in March. Conventional refinance FICO scores increased to 763, up from 758 in March, representing the highest such score since January 2013.\nATTOM Data Solutions, Irvine, Calif., quarterly U.S. Residential Property Mortgage Origination Report, showing 1.07 million refinance mortgages secured by residential property (1 to 4 units) originated in the first quarter, down 16 percent from the fourth quarter but up 87 percent from a year ago.\nWith low interest rates, refinance mortgages originated in the first quarter represented an estimated $328.5 billion in total dollar volume, down 16 percent from the previous quarter but up 105 percent from a year ago. Refinance loans accounted for 55.7 percent of all 1.92 million home loans in the first quarter, down slightly from 55.9 percent of loans in the fourth quarter, but up from 41.3 percent a year ago.\nATTOM also reported lenders originated 606,703 residential purchase mortgages in the first quarter, down 12 percent from the previous quarter, but up 13 percent from a year ago.\nRedfin, Seattle, said 41.1% of Redfin offers nationwide faced competition in the four weeks ending on May 10. In a handful of metros, the bidding war rate was above 60%.\nRedfin said the coronavirus pandemic is contributing to a shortage in the number of homes for sale across the U.S. as would-be sellers hold off on listing their homes amid ongoing uncertainty. The lack of inventory has led to a significant amount of bidding wars, particularly for single-family homes priced under $1 million in desirable areas.\nThe report said Boston had the highest rate of competition in the four weeks ending May 10, with 63.3% of offers written by Redfin agents on behalf of their homebuying customers facing bidding wars. San Francisco and Fort Worth, Texas trail closely, with bidding war rates of 63% and 62.2%, respectively.\nRed Bell Real Estate LLC, a division of Radian Inc., released its Radian Home Price Index showing home prices across the United States rose at an annualized rate of 6.1 percent in April from March.\nThe Radian HPI also rose 7.9 percent year-over-year (May 2019 to April 2020), slightly higher than the year-over-year increase of 7.7 percent recorded last month. Radian Senior Vice President of Data and Analytics Steve Gaenzler said while the impact of COVID-19 on real estate prices will be more visible over the coming months, more than six weeks into a near-national shutdown and widespread stay-at-home mandates, home prices have remained resilient, thus far.\nBlack Knight, Jacksonville, Fla., said 3.6 million homeowners were past due on their mortgages as of the end of April, the largest number since January 2015.\nThe company\u2019s First Look Mortgage Monitor said at 6.45%, the national delinquency rate nearly doubled (+3.06%) from March, the largest single-month increase ever recorded and nearly three times the previous single-month record set back in late 2008.\nThe report said delinquency increases in Nevada (+5.2%), New Jersey (+5.1%), and New York (+4.9%) led the states, while Miami (+7.2%), Las Vegas (+6.2%) and New York City (+5.4%) topped the 100 largest metro areas. Black Knight reported declines in cure activity among later-stage delinquencies as well, with the number of seriously delinquent mortgages (90+ days) increasing by 56,000 (+14%) from March.\nBoth foreclosure starts and foreclosure sales hit record lows in April as moratoriums halted foreclosure activity across the country. Prepayment speeds jumped 23% from March to hit the highest monthly prepayment rate in 16 years.\nRedfin, Seattle, said effects of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent shutdowns hit the housing market in full force in April, with sales and listings both turning in historic declines from year-ago levels. In the past two months, the housing market has seen the fastest slowdown on record as it flipped from one of the strongest markets ever at the end of February to a near standstill in April.\nRedfin said home sales in April plunged 22.5% from a year ago, as did both the number of homes newly listed for sale (-42.4%) and the number of homes available for sale (-24.5%). Home prices were still up from a year ago, but the rate of growth in the U.S. median home sale price stumbled slightly to 4.9% year over year, down from 6.9% in March. The national median sale price in April was $303,895.\nApril home sales fell 23% nationwide from March on a seasonally adjusted basis, by far the largest decline on record (Redfin data for this statistic goes back to January 2012). In general, markets with the biggest declines in home sales from a year ago were the most expensive, although due to especially tight restrictions on real estate during the shutdown, Detroit was also one of the three markets where sales slowed the most.\nTransUnion, Chicago issued a supplemental Monthly Snapshot report (https://content.transunion.com/v/monthly-industry-snapshot-april-final) showing the percentage of accounts entering \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d status has risen dramatically for credit products such as auto loans, credit cards, mortgages and personal loans.\nThe company\u2019s Q1 2020 Industry Insights Report and Monthly Industry Snapshot Report said serious mortgage delinquency rates declined to 1.40%, down four basis points from the same period last year \u2013 reversing the delinquency uptick from the past few quarters. According to the TransUnion credit database, 5% of all mortgages are currently in financial hardship, which includes forbearance programs as of April. Mortgage forbearance programs, which started in March, have allowed consumers enrolled in those programs to avoid being labeled as delinquent. This has kept delinquency rates at manageable levels in Q1 and is expected to continue into Q2.\nRedfin, Seattle, said the sudden shift to remote work, brought on by the coronavirus shutdowns, will likely accelerate a major migration away from expensive coastal cities. According to a new survey of homebuyers and sellers featured in Redfin\u2019s latest report, one in four newly remote workers expect to continue to work remotely once shutdowns end, and more than half of respondents would move if they never had to go into an office.\nRedfin said four in 10 survey respondents were not working remotely before the shutdowns but were able to during the shutdowns, and more than 28% of them said that they expect to continue to work remotely or have the option to work from home after the shutdown ends. In Seattle, 44% expect to work remotely indefinitely\u2014by far the highest of any of the high-cost cities surveyed.\nPayNearMe, Santa Clara, Calif., said payment volume through its network rose dramatically\u2013up to 40% above expectations based on historical volumes\u2013after the first stimulus checks reached consumer bank accounts. Automated Clearing House transfer and debit card payment volume increased, presumably because of perceived safety as consumers complied with shelter in place orders. Cash payments defied media narratives and remained relatively steady as a bill payment method.\nRedfin, Seattle, said pageviews of homes in small towns surged 105% year over year during the seven-day period ending May 1, an acceleration from the 85% gain that occurred during the week ending April 1. In rural counties with fewer than 10,000 people, views climbed 76%, a sizable increase from the prior year but a deceleration from the 170% rise a month before.\nMeanwhile, homes in urban metro areas with at least 1 million people saw a 16% rise in pageviews during the week ending May 1. That marks a reversal from the 13% decline Redfin saw a month prior, but still represents a much slower increase than small towns and rural areas are experiencing.\nA similar survey from Zillow, Seattle, suggests housing preferences could be upended in a post-pandemic America, leading to major questions about the future of dense metro cores. The survey said three quarters of Americans working from home because of the coronavirus say they want to continue if given the option, and two-thirds say they would consider moving if given that flexibility.\nZillow said a byproduct of such a trend could be larger homes with more rooms and offices could draw those no longer worried about their commute out of urban cores and into the suburbs and exurbs. Meanwhile, proximity to other amenities such as restaurants and entertainment venues could keep rural areas from seeing a surge.\n\u201cNow that more than half of employed Americans (56%) have had the opportunity to work from home, a vast majority want to continue, at least occasionally,\u201d Zillow said. The survey noted 75 percent of Americans working from home due to COVID-19 say they would prefer to continue that at least half the time, if given the option, after the pandemic subsides.\nZillow also reported for-sale listings of more affordable homes have been less affected by the slowdown, and now make up a larger-than-usual share of the market. New listings remain down 39% from last year, but have been rising for the past three weeks, perhaps in response to improved buyer demand; newly pending sales are up 7% from the previous week.\nNew listings of high-end homes dropped the farthest and fastest when the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S., while affordable listings were less affected. But as new listings have increased in recent weeks in response to strong buyer demand, more high-end homes are coming onto the market than any other type.\n", "prompt": "This week has produced more housing finance reports than you can shake a stick at.

Radian Senior Vice President of Data and Analytics Steve Gaenzler said while the impact of COVID-19 on real estate prices will be more visible over the coming months, more than six weeks into a near-national shutdown and widespread stay-at-home mandates, home prices have remained resilient, thus far.\nBlack Knight, Jacksonville, Fla., said 3.6 million homeowners were past due on their mortgages as of the end of April, the largest number since January 2015.\nThe company\u2019s First Look Mortgage Monitor said at 6.45%, the national delinquency rate nearly doubled (+3.06%) from March, the largest single-month increase ever recorded and nearly three times the previous single-month record set back in late 2008.\nThe report said delinquency increases in Nevada (+5.2%), New Jersey (+5.1%), and New York (+4.9%) led the states, while Miami (+7.2%), Las Vegas (+6.2%) and New York City (+5.4%) topped the 100 largest metro areas. Black Knight reported declines in cure activity among later-stage delinquencies as well, with the number of seriously delinquent mortgages (90+ days) increasing by 56,000 (+14%) from March.\nBoth foreclosure starts and foreclosure sales hit record lows in April as moratoriums halted foreclosure activity across the country. Prepayment speeds jumped 23% from March to hit the highest monthly prepayment rate in 16 years.\nRedfin, Seattle, said effects of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent shutdowns hit the housing market in full force in April, with sales and listings both turning in historic declines from year-ago levels. In the past two months, the housing market has seen the fastest slowdown on record as it flipped from one of the strongest markets ever at the end of February to a near standstill in April.\nRedfin said home sales in April plunged 22.5% from a year ago, as did both the number of homes newly listed for sale (-42.4%) and the number of homes available for sale (-24.5%). Home prices were still up from a year ago, but the rate of growth in the U.S. median home sale price stumbled slightly to 4.9% year over year, down from 6.9% in March. The national median sale price in April was $303,895.\nApril home sales fell 23% nationwide from March on a seasonally adjusted basis, by far the largest decline on record (Redfin data for this statistic goes back to January 2012). In general, markets with the biggest declines in home sales from a year ago were the most expensive, although due to especially tight restrictions on real estate during the shutdown, Detroit was also one of the three markets where sales slowed the most.\nTransUnion, Chicago issued a supplemental Monthly Snapshot report (https://content.transunion.com/v/monthly-industry-snapshot-april-final) showing the percentage of accounts entering \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d status has risen dramatically for credit products such as auto loans, credit cards, mortgages and personal loans.\nThe company\u2019s Q1 2020 Industry Insights Report and Monthly Industry Snapshot Report said serious mortgage delinquency rates declined to 1.40%, down four basis points from the same period last year \u2013 reversing the delinquency uptick from the past few quarters. According to the TransUnion credit database, 5% of all mortgages are currently in financial hardship, which includes forbearance programs as of April. Mortgage forbearance programs, which started in March, have allowed consumers enrolled in those programs to avoid being labeled as delinquent. This has kept delinquency rates at manageable levels in Q1 and is expected to continue into Q2.\nRedfin, Seattle, said the sudden shift to remote work, brought on by the coronavirus shutdowns, will likely accelerate a major migration away from expensive coastal cities. According to a new survey of homebuyers and sellers featured in Redfin\u2019s latest report, one in four newly remote workers expect to continue to work remotely once shutdowns end, and more than half of respondents would move if they never had to go into an office.\nRedfin said four in 10 survey respondents were not working remotely before the shutdowns but were able to during the shutdowns, and more than 28% of them said that they expect to continue to work remotely or have the option to work from home after the shutdown ends. In Seattle, 44% expect to work remotely indefinitely\u2014by far the highest of any of the high-cost cities surveyed.\nPayNearMe, Santa Clara, Calif., said payment volume through its network rose dramatically\u2013up to 40% above expectations based on historical volumes\u2013after the first stimulus checks reached consumer bank accounts. Automated Clearing House transfer and debit card payment volume increased, presumably because of perceived safety as consumers complied with shelter in place orders. Cash payments defied media narratives and remained relatively steady as a bill payment method.\nRedfin, Seattle, said pageviews of homes in small towns surged 105% year over year during the seven-day period ending May 1, an acceleration from the 85% gain that occurred during the week ending April 1. In rural counties with fewer than 10,000 people, views climbed 76%, a sizable increase from the prior year but a deceleration from the 170% rise a month before.\nMeanwhile, homes in urban metro areas with at least 1 million people saw a 16% rise in pageviews during the week ending May 1. That marks a reversal from the 13% decline Redfin saw a month prior, but still represents a much slower increase than small towns and rural areas are experiencing.\nA similar survey from Zillow, Seattle, suggests housing preferences could be upended in a post-pandemic America, leading to major questions about the future of dense metro cores. The survey said three quarters of Americans working from home because of the coronavirus say they want to continue if given the option, and two-thirds say they would consider moving if given that flexibility.\nZillow said a byproduct of such a trend could be larger homes with more rooms and offices could draw those no longer worried about their commute out of urban cores and into the suburbs and exurbs. Meanwhile, proximity to other amenities such as restaurants and entertainment venues could keep rural areas from seeing a surge.\n\u201cNow that more than half of employed Americans (56%) have had the opportunity to work from home, a vast majority want to continue, at least occasionally,\u201d Zillow said. The survey noted 75 percent of Americans working from home due to COVID-19 say they would prefer to continue that at least half the time, if given the option, after the pandemic subsides.\nZillow also reported for-sale listings of more affordable homes have been less affected by the slowdown, and now make up a larger-than-usual share of the market. New listings remain down 39% from last year, but have been rising for the past three weeks, perhaps in response to improved buyer demand; newly pending sales are up 7% from the previous week.\nNew listings of high-end homes dropped the farthest and fastest when the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S., while affordable listings were less affected. But as new listings have increased in recent weeks in response to strong buyer demand, more high-end homes are coming onto the market than any other type.\n\nWrite a 500-word creative story: What about a story about someone who has a job and works from home now?

In it, two rules define what type of traffic is allowed for each network: inbound for Network A, and allowing anything for Network B and C.\n\nHere's what those configs looked like:\n\napiVersion: rc.app.stacks/v1beta2\nkind: RuntimeComponent\nmetadata:\n  name: network-policy-rc\nspec:\n  applicationImage: k8s.gcr.io/pause:2.0\n  service:\n    port: 8080\n\nnetwork-policy-rc.yaml\n\n# Network A\napiVersion: rc.app.stacks/v1beta2\nkind: RuntimeComponent\nmetadata:\n  name: network-policy-rc\nspec:\n  applicationImage: k8s.gcr.io/pause:2.0\n  service:\n    port: 8080\nnetwork-policy-rc.yaml\nnetwork-policy-rc.yaml\nnetwork-policy-rc.yaml\n\nEach of these configurations is responsible for defining what kind of traffic is allowed for a single network. But how did they know which configuration matched which network? Well, remember how I said that these configurations were associated with AppStack's Network component? AppStack takes care of associating these configurations with the correct networks automatically. So now, each network receives the appropriate traffic rules, making everyone happy in the land of Stack.", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 192, "avg_token_entropy": 1.1247533492909538, "avg_token_perplexity": 5.0636828162126015, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

As this happens, the use of computers will continue to increase exponentially. In the coming years and decades, the need for reliable and secure Internet service will grow as we become increasingly reliant on our data to make decisions, whether in business or in our everyday lives. But with these growing needs, comes greater exposure to threats and security risks. In today\u2019s digital age, a business cannot expect to stay competitive without a strong security plan that accounts for the growing complexities of these environments and the evolving tactics of today\u2019s threat landscape. \"\nThe following are examples of creative stories you can get ideas from for your creative story, these examples are for the topic: My Role As a Student\nExample 1\nOn the first day of school, I was not sure how I was going to make any new friends. I am the type of person who prefers to be around a small group of friends. My mom, however, had other plans for me. Before going on this trip, she had me do lots of research on the area. My father is from another country and my mom is from a different state, so neither of them knew much about the area. My mom was a nurse and my dad was an engineer. They both worked hard for what they had and were able to send me to a great university that was close to home. As soon as we got there, I was a little overwhelmed by the size of the university. It was huge! The first week was an orientation week, so I thought I would make my own schedule to go to different classes and meet different people. On the second day of classes, I had a statistics class that was the same time as my math class, so I had to choose which one to go to. Luckily, there was another student in my class who looked like he was lost. He introduced himself as David and we started talking. He asked me if I would like to go to lunch with him. He was funny and kind of shy and it felt really natural to be around him. David was the type of person who was really smart, but still very humble and down to earth. He knew how to have fun without being a goofball. As we got closer, I found out that he loved doing things like rock climbing, hiking and camping.
