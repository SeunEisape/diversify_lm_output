As in other parts of the United States, Georgia's temperance reformers typically were evangelical Protestants who regarded alcoholic beverages as harmful (even sinful) for the individual drinker and for society at large. Supposedly, drink destroyed families and reputations and brought about poverty, disorder, and crime. As elsewhere, Georgia's temperance reformers started by urging individuals to decide voluntarily not to drink and later campaigned to change the laws to restrict and abolish the sale of alcoholic beverages. Georgia had statewide prohibition from 1908 until 1935, a period that began before and extended beyond national prohibition (1920-33).\nGeorgia State Temperance Society, organized in 1828, at first met concurrently with the Baptist state convention. The state society sent delegates to the American Temperance Society but was never formally affiliated with it. Originally this first statewide society committed its members to moderation in the consumption of distilled liquors. When it attempted in 1836 to shift to a teetotal pledge, the society broke up and disappeared. One of the few affiliated local societies to survive was in Augusta, for many years a temperance stronghold.\nIn the 1840s and 1850s the Georgia temperance movement shared in national enthusiasms: Washingtonianism, which employed the testimonials of reformed drunkards to encourage men to pledge themselves to give up drink; and fraternal societies, such as the Sons of Temperance, which combined quasi-Masonic ritual and mutual insurance with teetotalism.\nPrewar temperance reformers explored the political road to temperance. In the late 1830s a petition movement called for an end to retail liquor licenses. In 1855, influenced by the example of statutory prohibition in the state of Maine, a temperance convention meeting in Atlanta nominated a Methodist minister, B. H. Overby, as a candidate for governor on a platform of statewide prohibition.\nBefore the Civil War (1861-65), some white Georgians may have associated temperance with northern abolitionists and consequently rejected it. Lagging economic development also handicapped the temperance cause, given that this modernizing ideology had little appeal in predominantly rural Georgia. Finally, Georgians disliked laws that restricted their personal liberty.\nAfter the war the temperance movement was both hurt and helped by racism. White Georgians resisted any mixing of the races in temperance organizations but were eager to make it illegal for emancipated African Americans to drink alcoholic beverages. Prohibition of alcoholic drink became intertwined with black disenfranchisement and subordination.\nIn 1867 James G. Thrower, a British immigrant, introduced the Order of Good Templars to Georgia, assembling the first state lodge in Atlanta in 1869. Unlike most fraternal societies, the Good Templars admitted both men and women and let local affiliates decide about African Americans. Members who opposed African American membership at any location quit in the early 1870s to form the exclusively white United Friends of Temperance. Around the same time, white Good Templars in Kentucky organized a Jim Crow temperance society called the True Reformers for blacks; the movement reached Georgia about 1874. When in 1876 the international Good Templar order broke up over the question of the rights of blacks, white Good Templars in Georgia appeased northerners by organizing a \"dual\" grand lodge for black teetotalers, who could enjoy the Good Templar name and ritual but not meet at lodges with whites. At the same time the predominantly British party in the divided Good Templar order employed northern-born schoolteachers to organize a nominally integrated grand lodge that de facto was black. By the late 1880s few Good Templars of either race survived in Georgia.\nBy this time other organizations dominated the temperance movement.\nIn 1880 the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) established its first society in Georgia, and in 1883 a statewide WCTU was organized. In 1884 an umbrella organization, called the Georgia Temperance Association, was created. It was superseded in 1905 when the Anti-Saloon League of America was organized in the state.\nthe late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries temperance reformers attempted to persuade the state government to enact restrictive liquor legislation and the voters to implement local option powers. An 1885 statute granted voters the right to impose prohibition in the county where they lived. By 1907 most counties had voted themselves dry. That same year the state legislature enacted mandatory statewide prohibition, one of the moral reforms demanded by Progressives throughout the South. The Atlanta race riot of 1906 probably encouraged the enactment of prohibition; whites feared the consequences of African Americans' drinking, and furthermore, white mobs originated in bars and saloons.\nThe new law went into effect in 1908. For a time the legislature offered the \"wets\" some loopholes\u2014near-beer saloons serving low-alcohol drinks were permitted, as were alcoholic beverages in locker-clubs\u2014but these were closed in 1915.

It did not vote for repeal of national prohibition, but after that occurred, Georgia repealed its own statewide prohibition in 1935.\nDavid M.

You can purchase clay at your local gardening center or hardware store. Look for a clay-based potting mix that's made from a 2:1 ratio of clay to compost. Alternatively, you can use a compost-based potting mix. However, if you don't use a clay base, you'll need to check the pH of your soil each year and add compost if it becomes too acidic.

Fill in the corners of your planter box with your soil to make sure it's packed tightly. Leave a 1- to 2-inch (2.5 to 5.1\u00a0cm) layer of space between your soil and your top wall. This space will let water slowly leak back into the soil as it evaporates. If your box is very deep, leave 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2\u00a0cm) of space. Your box should be full of soil now, but don't cover your plants just yet. To give them room to breathe, create a small \"well\" on the 1 side of your planter box. Then, carefully place your plants into the well and fill it in with soil. You can continue to fill in around the base of your plant with soil as needed.

Frostenson price stand in the center of the scandal, the literature, the Nobel Academy.\nWith her, an Agreement had been reached, that you get 12.875 Swedish crowns (around 1250 Euro) per month as compensation. In addition, you get support for it, so she could continue to live in the apartment that you\u2019ve rented from the Academy. They had jointly come to the conclusion that a court follows a meal procedure in the dispute no sense. The Academy pointed to the long-term merits of Frostenson.\nThe scandal at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel prize in literature, revolves around Frostensons husband, the Director Jean-Claude Arnault, and take care of yourself. Arnault was sentenced in early December by a court of appeal in Stockholm for the rape of two and a half years in prison. In addition, the Academy accuses Frostenson, the winner of the Nobel prize for literature to him in advance blabbed and to have that confidentiality breached.\nFrostenson had made financial demands to the Academy for their exit. The dispute has led to several resignations and, ultimately, to the fact that in the past year, not a Nobel prize for literature was awarded.\n\nWrite a numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing:1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

It is faster to write documents such as letters and reports using a computer than it is to write it by hand. If the document is then needed for publication, there is a software package available to the user which will take their document and make it look very professional. Another use is for bookkeeping purposes. Using software to record all financial activities keeps the business records up-to-date. This will help prevent mistakes, as well as save time and money. Also, should any problem ever come up about a transaction, this software will provide hard copy documentation. Software also provides accounting software, which is one of the most important uses for computers. The accounting software helps businesses keep track of how much they spend, how much they charge to whom and also how much profit they made. If a business needs to take a tax deduction, it will know what to deduct and how much by using accounting software. This software also helps businesses prepare financial statements. Computer software is used in the medical field. It is used in hospitals and medical laboratories to help doctors analyze and diagnose medical issues. It keeps track of patients and their treatment history. The uses for computers have become almost unlimited. There are many ways to use a computer. Almost anything can be done from a computer and it is always becoming easier to learn how to do something new with your computer. Computers have become one of the most widely used machines.

I hope to read your comments. Kisses! Bye.\nWe just want to have fun with you. This is why we write on this libertine dating site because we love playing with other naughty people during libertine parties. We're available in the afternoon to have fun and catch up. We would prefer to give you an appointment at our place if that suits you. We enjoy spending evenings in libertine clubs on Gadsden in order to find new couples. This is primarily for me because I'm naughty with men and I have very few limits. You can write a short note, we will be happy to look at it. We hope to see you for a lovely swingers' meetup.

For this libertine rendezvous, we want a kinky guy or couple without any taboos because we desire to get laid as much as possible!!! Mister is going to have to be athletic, sorry but that's my whim right now. We practice several libertine practices. We are passionate about threesome and especially exhibitionism. In actuality, kissing outdoors is one of our favorite hobbies. We can free ourselves up this weekend for a libertine date night in Newton. We would like to see you in a swingers club.

I'm here to show you how you need to make me have a great excitement. I'm a cougar woman, and I'm excited by young boys who are no more than 41 years old. I love ordering during a one-night stand because I know exactly how to turn you on. I have no taboos because I am a greedy lady. We can see each other on Leominster and its surroundings. We can generally meet up at the end of the week to see each other.  If you please, let me know. I would be happy to provide you with my email or phone number so we can communicate. See you soon.\nSince we work a lot, we would like to see you on Saturday and preferably at our place or in a hot club next to Dundalk. There are many sexual things that people do. We're passionate about orgies and particularly exhibitionism. There is no denying that having intimate relations in the forest is one of our favorite hobbies.

We compare the results obtained for different algorithms by measuring the recall, precision and F-measure. We also study the effect of different data sets (Dorian, 2018). 5. In this project, we propose a method for analyzing text similarity. The method is based on comparing the similarity of two texts based on their lexical densities. The proposed method can be used to analyze different texts and find out their similarities. The method can be used for the analysis of different types of texts such as blogs, news articles, product reviews, etc. 6. We propose a method for automatic emotion detection in texts. The method uses features such as word frequency and sentiment analysis to detect emotions in a text. The method is implemented using Python. 7. We propose a method for detecting the sentiment of a text. The method uses features such as the polarity of a text and its sentiment orientation. The method is implemented using Python. 8. We introduce a new metric for text classification, called the Sentiment Strength. The Sentiment Strength measures the degree of positivity or negativity of a given text. The metric is computed by analyzing the frequency and polarity of words in a given text. The metric can be used to classify a given text into positive, negative and neutral categories. The metric is implemented using Python. 9. We introduce a novel approach to detect the polarity of a given text. The method uses a linguistic measure called the Polarity Score. The Polarity Score is computed by analyzing the degree of positivity or negativity of a given text. The metric is computed by using a combination of two different linguistic techniques, namely word frequency analysis and sentiment analysis. The metric is implemented using Python. 10.

That is, given a task, we do not directly model the output but instead find intermediate features that make the task easier to solve. Representation learning is often used to describe techniques for finding an underlying low-dimensional manifold or cluster structure in a dataset.\n\nIn this section, we will review representation learning techniques for social good applications. We will focus specifically on techniques used to cluster individuals based on their interests or demographics.\n\nTo start, let us consider the problem of automatically assigning individuals to social classes based on their behaviors or attributes. For example, one might want to identify which individuals are at risk of becoming homeless, so they can be targeted for assistance. Or one might want to identify individuals who are likely to commit crimes, so they can be subject to stricter punishment or intervention.\n\nOne approach to solving these problems is to use clustering algorithms to group individuals into classes based on their shared attributes. For instance, we could train a classifier to predict whether an individual is at risk of becoming homeless by using features such as income level, employment status, housing conditions, mental health status, etc. Once trained, we could use this classifier to sort individuals into different classes based on which categories they fall into, such as high-income, low-income, employed, unemployed, stable, unstable, etc.\n\nOnce we have sorted individuals into classes, we can then use these labels to predict other relevant variables. For instance, we might use the labels we have generated to predict whether an individual will commit crimes. We would do this by training another classifier that takes as input the label (e.g., high-income versus low-income) and outputs a prediction of whether or not the individual will commit crimes. By combining our clustering algorithm with a classifier, we can effectively cluster individuals based on multiple variables simultaneously.\n\nThere are several well-known clustering algorithms available, including k-means, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC), and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). Each of these algorithms works differently, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFor instance, k-means requires specifying the number of clusters a priori, and may not handle noisy data well. HAC produces hierarchies of clusters, which can help interpret the results more intuitively. And DBSCAN excels at identifying clusters", "completion_only": "4.5.6. ...\n\nWrite a long and very detailed course unit for a textbook on \"Machine Learning Methods for Social Good\" intended for young children.\nA crucial concept in machine learning is the idea of representation learning.

I like that Visiting Angels tries hard to get someone to meet our needs; however, we had to go through 5 caregivers first. The good thing about them is that for the past year we have had the same caregiver.\nI was able to take my daughter to appointments, and I wouldn't have been able to unless someone was here for a few hours. It was a tough time because he was in pain and my mind was elsewhere, and it was wonderful to have them. They were friendly, prompt, and took care of my husband with whatever he needed.\nI want them to exercise her physically and mentally, they do those things, I just wish they would do them more. This last weekend was Memorial Day and there was a confusion about our caregiver. The company called to let us know that there wouldn't be a caregiver on Monday, but then they ended up sending someone to provide service.\nThey visit and answer my questions. It was wonderful to have them here. They were a blessing.\nThey do their job very well. They speak with her in a friendly, respectful, and cheerful way. The two specific caregivers are very good. They get along well with my aunt, there is no criticism whatsoever.\nI didn't have any problem when they were there. They stayed in contact with her, the did some light cooking, and they had to tell my father when to do her pills. They did light housework and bathing her. They could have cooked for. The only problem I ran into was that there was two or three days they couldn't have someone there.\nThey have been very cordial. I had some trouble when we first started up with some communication errors, but now we have a great caregiver that both me and my dad really like! I did not have anybody to take care of my dad, it almost felt like I was in jail! Now I have a day or two during the week where I can get out.\nIf you get lucky, you get the right person. The caregiver is very aware of what I need and when I need it.\nTheir lack in caregivers for our area is an issue. They take care of my mother during the day, so we are able to work.\nThe caregivers are on time when they say they will be coming. They help with things like lifting my husband into and out of bed, take him to any appointments he might have, and pick up his medications. They also help with the housework.\nThey are still getting their feet wet to find people to do the services for us. They have done a good job learning about my mother. We have been able to find two caregivers for my mom. It helps me because I am not in town, and I am the only child of hers that is alive. It brings me peace of mind that they are there for her.\nWe have had some caregivers that were not so good, but the last two that we have had have been very good. They help him to get to the bathroom, are there from dinner until he goes to bed, make sure that he has water, and makes sure that his needs are met for dinner.\nI would tell others that Visiting Angels is responsive, flexible, and professional. They make daily efforts to accommodate our needs. My father has Alzheimer's so he gets cranky but he usually perks up when his caregiver shows up.\nVisiting Angels had very nice and helpful caregivers. Visiting Angels made life easier by helping me and my loved one with things we can't do ourselves.\nI'm less likely to recommend Visiting Angels because many of the caregivers don't show up, so there's that lack of consistency. I didn't like that the caregiver we had for a while was here last Friday, and she knew she was leaving but didn't say goodbye before she quit. I thought that was rude, although they said that was policy. However, they did get someone right away for me who seems to be okay. The impact Visiting Angels' services has on my husband's life is tremendous. It also makes a huge impact for me because I need their help so much.\nI would recommend Visiting Angels because they'e just been very thoughtful and careful from the beginning, explaining things to us carefully. We've had now two people who've come and they've both been terrific. The service has helped because I'm able to go out and do things on my own, so I don't have to worry about leaving my husband and the two people who've come have taken him over to the fitness center so he has something to do while I'm not here, and then also giving him a shower.\nMy loved one really needed Visiting Angels, and I couldn't always be there. Visiting Angels gave me a lot of peace of mind.\nI would tell someone that everything was satisfactory with Visiting Angels, that they were helpful and informative, and that I have nothing but good to say about them. The most helpful thing about the services was that someone was checking up on my uncle when we couldn't be there.\nWe have been using VIsting Angels for a few weeks and have found the staff (from intake with Toni, to caretaker Danyale) to be caring and helpful in the service they provide.\nVisiting Angels is not new, but new to the Charlottesville area and we have had some of the best caregivers come through our agency. We also have had some of the best, most loving clients anyone could ask for. Thank you for the kind words. We appreciate your business and will always value your opinion.\nWhat should caregivers and potential clients know about Visiting Angels - Charlottesville, VA?\nWrite a numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing:1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

In a world where everything is connected, you need to ensure your business isn\u2019t leaving itself open to attack. Here are some vulnerability management best practices to keep your organization secure.\nWhy Is Vulnerability Management Important for Enterprises?\nSometimes it takes seeing a price tag for business leaders to understand the importance of something. When it comes to vulnerability management, the fact that the average U.S. data breach costs about $8.64 million should get attention.\nVulnerability management is a way of mitigating risks associated with enterprise network weaknesses. There are many of these, and the list gets longer by the day. It\u2019s not just that the bad guys are getting more sophisticated, technology is changing faster and faster. Introducing vulnerability management tools and protocols allows organizations to stay ahead of these threats through better detection, documentation, and response.\nWhen running a business, there are some things you can keep on the back burner. For instance, updating your marketing materials is an important part of your organization, but failure to do so in time isn\u2019t likely to cause immediate disaster.\nThe same thing, however, can\u2019t be said for vulnerability management. The whole point of these tools and protocols is to ensure that nothing terrible happens that would lead to massive data loss and potential liability. Still, enterprises need to have a fully fleshed out vulnerability management plan, not just some ideas to implement at some undetermined date.\nThere are four main aspects to vulnerability management, which work together in a sort of cyclical defense system. Those four properties are detection, reporting, analysis, and mitigation. Vulnerability management works by constantly scanning your organizational assets. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a server room or a single laptop, anything connected to your networks has the potential to create vulnerability.\nYour vulnerability management arsenal should continually scan all endpoints on your network, which will create a findings report. From there, it\u2019s possible to decide whether actions are necessary for issue resolution. At this point, mitigation becomes the focus.\nOne factor that needs to be considered in every organization\u2019s vulnerability management plan is the personnel involved. It\u2019s important to get people in your IT department who can make informed decisions about building a vulnerability management plan.\nHowever, many enterprises will find they want to add outside help to assure they have the best vulnerability management setup. Having top experts in vulnerability management working along with your team can be an ideal way to protect network systems.\nThis can be cited as another reason why it makes sense for many enterprises to work with a specialized network security company when building a vulnerability management strategy. Having the best tools and software applications is going to vastly improve the efficacy of your vulnerability management. While your internal team will be able to do some research, and likely have some expertise, it won\u2019t be anywhere near the level of an external organization.\nWhen it comes to protecting your networks, it really doesn\u2019t make sense to spare expenses. Being stingy on the front end can lead to much bigger problems down the line.\nAutomating as many processes in your vulnerability management suite as possible will be beneficial to your enterprise. Much of the detection aspects can and should be done autonomously. You\u2019ll want these systems running as much as you can, as long as they don\u2019t cause network disruptions.

It is also highly beneficial to have at least two diversity antennas available, in particular, if there is no multipath diversity provided by the channel. The results also show that the reduction of intercell multiple-access interference yields a significant performance advantage in cellular networks. It is also demonstrated that the combination of spatial diversity and a multiuser receiver provides a significant receiver performance or system capacity gain in comparison to implementing only one of them.\nWrite a numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing:1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

The analysis is applied to evaluate the BEP in antenna diversity reception and in a cellular CDMA system. Diversity and multiuser receivers are compared based on the examples. It is observed that adding new diversity antenna elements improves performance even if the correlation between the antenna elements is relatively large (up to 0.7). However, the large correlation values pose a significant reduction in the diversity gain in comparison to the zero correlation. It is also seen that the macroscopic diversity improves the performance of receivers significantly in cellular CDMA networks.

Climate change refers to any significant long-term change in the average climate patterns that are happening over several decades or longer. The term \"climate change\" also refers to changes in average weather conditions that result from climate change. These changes may be observed in rainfall patterns, temperatures, and other climate variables over time and space. It is important to note that climate change is a slow process and should not be confused with seasonal changes, which are natural variations in weather conditions over short periods of time. Climate change is caused by human activities, which change the composition of the atmosphere, causing the Earth's temperature to rise. The most significant contributors to climate change are fossil fuel emissions, deforestation, and agriculture, all of which contribute to the greenhouse effect. As a result, there is a clear link between climate change and global warming, which is the heating of Earth's surface and atmosphere. The Earth's temperature has risen by about 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) since the pre-industrial era (about 1880). This has contributed to climate change and global warming. Another major contributor to climate change and global warming is an increase in the greenhouse effect. When sunlight hits the Earth, it heats the surface and lower atmosphere, which in turn emits radiation in the form of heat. The emitted radiation would normally be sent back into space, but an increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps more of it", "completion_only": "3.

The term \"climate change\" also refers to changes in average weather conditions that result from climate change. These changes may be observed in rainfall patterns, temperatures, and other climate variables over time and space. It is important to note that climate change is a slow process and should not be confused with seasonal changes, which are natural variations in weather conditions over short periods of time. Climate change is caused by human activities, which change the composition of the atmosphere, causing the Earth's temperature to rise. The most significant contributors to climate change are fossil fuel emissions, deforestation, and agriculture, all of which contribute to the greenhouse effect. As a result, there is a clear link between climate change and global warming, which is the heating of Earth's surface and atmosphere. The Earth's temperature has risen by about 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) since the pre-industrial era (about 1880). This has contributed to climate change and global warming. Another major contributor to climate change and global warming is an increase in the greenhouse effect. When sunlight hits the Earth, it heats the surface and lower atmosphere, which in turn emits radiation in the form of heat. The emitted radiation would normally be sent back into space, but an increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps more of it", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 69, "avg_token_entropy": 1.2284258444011218, "avg_token_perplexity": 5.15499211220114, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

Moreover, scientists are using stem cells as tools for a vast scope of work, from basic-science investigations of how the human genome is regulated to translational research seeking to pinpoint disease mechanisms or test novel drugs.\nToday it\u2019s hard to imagine where 21st-century science would be without stem cells, but their career as research subjects wasn\u2019t always smooth.\nIt was at the start of the new millennium that scientists learned how to grow embryonic stem cells in the lab and nudge the cells to take on new identities. The research attracted headlines partly because of controversy around how the cells were obtained\u2014typically from leftover embryos generated during in vitro fertilization treatment\u2014and partly because they held promise for regenerative medicine, the idea of using stem cells to replace diseased cells or tissues in patients.

Photo by Matthew Septimus.\nIndeed, working with human embryonic stem cells was challenging from the start, and remained difficult even after 2006, when new technologies allowed scientists to create so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by reprogramming somatic cells such as skin cells into an embryonic-like state. The iPSCs behaved similarly to stem cells derived from embryos and promised a limitless supply of pluripotent cells for research and medical applications, but they came with their own peculiarities and safety concerns. Scientists also developed methods to guide iPSCs or human embryonic stem cells to differentiate into slightly more mature cells called progenitors, but attempts to push them further, toward full specialization, kept failing. There were multiple challenges, starting with the fact that no developing cell operates in isolation\u2014to function normally, it must exchange signals with nearby cells and sometimes connect with nerves, arteries, and nonliving material in the tissue. It\u2019s a puzzle with so many pieces that its solution may still be decades away.\n50\u201370Number of times a normal human cell may divide before it starts to deteriorate.\n\u221eNumber of times a human stem cell may divide.\nThere were other hurdles, too. The creation of the first human embryonic stem cell line caused a cultural uproar so loud that it almost brought the science to a halt. Several European countries banned the creation of the cells, and in the United States, then president George W. Bush cut off the field\u2019s access to government funding. Scientists had to secure private funding for work involving embryonic stem cells and, to comply with federal regulations, erect physical barriers in their labs to separate privately funded work on stem cells from government-funded research.\nIt was in such a cordoned-off corner that Brivanlou\u2019s team began studying natural human embryos and deriving cell lines from them. They also developed a platform that made it possible to grow the embryos in petri dishes, even past day seven, when normal embryos need a uterus to survive. For the first time, they could watch the transformations taking place during the second week of human embryogenesis, up until around day 14. This is when a milestone called symmetry breaking occurs\u2014characterized by the emergence of the body\u2019s three axes (head to foot, front to back, left to right).\nTo observe later developmental stages, Brivanlou\u2019s lab and Rockefeller physicist Eric Siggia created synthetic human embryos growing as self-organizing 3D cultures. These embryo models mimic the geometry of natural embryos and can be induced to undergo symmetry breaking, giving researchers a way to study the biological events occurring in the third week of development. They have also provided some of the most striking pictures of early human life ever seen.\nWATCH: Ali H. Brivanlou on the ethics of studying human embryonic stem cells.\nCurrently, only a small fraction of embryos generated in fertility clinics are used for transfer to the uterus. Most are deemed deficient, flagged by a test detecting an abnormal number of chromosomes. But the team found that these supposedly nonviable embryos often self-correct as they grow, in a complex process that eliminates cells with irregular chromosome numbers from the fetus. These results are in line with earlier observations that when such abnormal embryos are implanted in a prospective parent, they survive just as often as embryos that test normal and produce healthy babies.\n\u201cThese embryos are viable and should no longer be discarded,\u201d Brivanlou says.\nMoreover, the synthetic embryos have created unprecedented opportunities for studying disease mechanisms and testing new drugs. One striking example is the lab\u2019s use of the technology to study Huntington\u2019s disease. This inherited neurodegenerative disorder was long thought to start in middle age, when symptoms typically emerge. But the researchers found that earlier signs of Huntington\u2019s arise before birth, in the first two weeks of embryonic development. \u201cThis suggests that what we\u2019ve long thought of as an age-related condition may in fact be a developmental disease,\u201d Brivanlou says.\nAnother technology that emerged from stem cell research is the organoid. From their human embryonic stem cell lines, Brivanlou and his colleagues created brain organoids\u2014tiny 3D cultures of embryonic neural tissue for studying Huntington\u2019s and screening for novel drugs. And when the pandemic hit, they created other organoids that model embryonic lung tissue, providing a system to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 damages airways and alveoli in people with severe COVID.\n\u201cThis technology really opens a door to identifying the mechanisms by which organs like the brain or lungs normally develop, understanding how they go awry in disease, and testing drugs that set these mechanisms back on the right course,\u201d says Brivanlou.\nGerman biologist Ernst Haeckel coins the term stamzelle (stem cell in German) describing the hypothetical ancestral cell from which all multicellular organisms evolved.\nGerman scientists Theodor Boveri and Valentin H\u00e4cker pronounce the stem cell the mother cell of the germ line, based on the theory that there is a common cell capable of self-renewal and differentiation.\nThe first allogeneic bone marrow transplant is performed in France, on survivors of a nuclear accident.

Brivanlou develops a microchip-based system to grow synthetic human embryos in culture.\nLearn more about these milestones in the story.\nIn the 1970s, a series of botched experiments led Howard Green, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to a surprise discovery. While unsuccessfully trying to replicate a rare cancer in a petri dish, Green noticed that the tumor-derived cells were forming structures resembling the outer layer of the skin, or epidermis. This \u201ctest-tube skin,\u201d as he called it, was so similar to real skin that it could be used for skin grafting. In an oft-cited procedure in 1983, Green and others regenerated massive amounts of epidermis and saved the lives of two boys whose bodies were covered with third-degree burns. But Green didn\u2019t know why his cultured cells could magically generate new tissue. What was going on inside that dish?\n50\u2013150Number of cells in an embryo five days after fertilization.\nEventually, he figured it out: Some of the cells had the capacity to divide over and over without specializing. Without these cells, now known as adult stem cells, no epidermal structures would grow.\nAdult stem cells can be found in virtually all the body\u2019s organs, where they live in localized homes called niches and self-generate to replenish the surrounding tissue. If it weren\u2019t for adult stem cells, these organs would wither and we wouldn\u2019t live long.\nElaine Fuchs was in graduate school when a lecture by Green upended her plans. Well on her way to becoming a microbiologist, she was so intrigued by the new discoveries that she switched gears and joined Green\u2019s lab as a postdoc. Today, four decades later, she continues to study epidermal stem cells, which have guided her to numerous discoveries in far-ranging fields, from inflammation to cancer.\nEpidermal stem cells (green) form small buds that might later develop into tumors. Photo by Robin Chemers Neustein Laboratory of Mammalian Cell Biology and Development.\nBecause stem cells continually exchange signals with their surroundings, Fuchs adds, all efforts to grow tissue in a dish begin with decoding the signals those cells use to communicate.\nIn the skin, specialized stem cells make the epidermis, hair follicles, and sweat glands; and in other organs like the intestines and lungs, different epithelial stem cell types regenerate similar absorptive layers. Bit by bit, Fuchs\u2019s lab is piecing together what goes on in the niches of these different stem cells, pinpointing the specialized microenvironments that nourish and guide them, and how those environments change in injury, inflammation, and cancer.\n\u201cIn the skin, there are 65 different cell types, and we believe a good number of them interact with stem cell niches in various ways and at different times,\u201d Fuchs says. Neurons, fibroblasts, adipocytes, muscle cells, and immune cells all communicate with skin stem cells to do the right thing at the right time. And recently, the lab discovered that the lymphatic vasculature wrapping around the niches synchronizes the activities of stem cells across a tissue. The dynamic interplay between stem cells and their niche is at the heart of the skin\u2019s routine maintenance and its ability to repair wounds, Fuchs says, and it also plays a role in many medical conditions\u2014enough to keep her lab perpetually busy.\nIn eavesdropping on stem cells in their niche, the lab has made several surprising discoveries. Among them is the fact that many chronic conditions traditionally considered immune disorders\u2014including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma\u2014might be the result not of a malfunctioning immune system but rather what happens when epithelial stem cells lose the ability to mount a robust barrier against pathogens or when they miscommunicate with the immune system. Moreover, Fuchs and her coworkers suspect that chronic inflammatory diseases may occur because stem cells harbor memories of past inflammatory episodes, causing them to react too quickly to a new trigger.\nEpithelial stem cells have led Fuchs to discoveries in far-ranging fields, from chronic inflammatory diseases to cancer. Photo by John Abbott.\nIt was Fuchs and her colleagues who discovered in 2017 that stem cells draw on their memories in responding to threats\u2014a process similar to immune cells\u2019 ability to remember a pathogen and respond more quickly on subsequent encounters. It\u2019s generally a useful adaptive mechanism that strengthens the body\u2019s defenses throughout life. The problem, Fuchs explains, is that repeated assaults might cause the cells to overreact to irritants or pathogens, leading to runaway inflammation that may manifest as rashes, pain, and other symptoms typically seen in these disorders. And her research suggests that stem cell memories are long-lasting: In a lab mouse, they can persist for up to six months, the equivalent of about five human years.\nCan these memories be erased? Fuchs thinks so, and her team is exploring this possibility. Ultimately, the researchers hope that their work will lead to the development of new treatments for chronic inflammatory conditions to replace current immunosuppressive drugs, which have undesirable side effects and are not always effective.\n1Number of epidermal stem cells needed to generate enough skin to cover the adult body.\n>200Number of cell types in the human body.\nThere are other circumstances in which adult stem cells trigger disease instead of healing and protecting their native tissue. One is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, a highly aggressive type of skin cancer that Fuchs and her coworkers have studied for many years.\nLike most of the body\u2019s tissues, healthy skin epithelium contains many mutant cells, which is usually not a problem. When a mutant shows up, neighboring cells will keep it in check by curbing its proliferation, for example\u2014and after a day or two, the cell will die. But if the mutant happens to be a stem cell, which is the case in squamous cell carcinoma, the scenario becomes far more dangerous. Because it can self-renew indefinitely, the stem cell will hold on to all the mutations it has gained in the past, building a vast repertoire of genetic errors and improving its chances of dodging the intrusive neighbors.\nHow does this cell dupe nearby cells, and how does it cut itself loose from its locale of origin to leak into the bloodstream and metastasize? \u201cThe epithelial stem cell has to manage to survive in order to give rise to cancer, and to do that it needs to change the way it communicates with other cells,\u201d Fuchs says.\n65Number of cell types in the skin.\n>1MNumber of stem-cell transplants performed to regenerate blood cells in patients.\nShe and her coworkers found that the mutant cell can create an escape route by generating stiffer surrounding tissue. As a result, mechanical forces build up, allowing the mutant to break through and pierce into deeper layers of the skin, from where it can spread further throughout the body via capillaries. More benign skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas, on the other hand, produce less rigid cell structures and are more likely to stay put.\nThe lab is now working to pinpoint which of the many mutations found in squamous cell carcinomas are responsible for hijacking the normal ability of epithelial stem cells to proliferate and heal wounds. \u201cFiguring this out will get us much closer to understanding how the disease advances and develop effective interventions,\u201d says Fuchs, the Rebecca C. Lancefield Professor.\nLike Fuchs, C. David Allis followed the science where it led him\u2014and became a cancer biologist along the way. A pioneer in the study of epigenetics, he began working in stem cells because they provide a convenient model, a cell-based system for studying an organism\u2019s entire genome in action.  Every part of their genome is flexible, allowing scientists to explore a vast universe of epigenetic programming taking place in development, dementia, depression, or your biological context of choice.\nWith his coworkers, Allis, who is Rockefeller\u2019s Joy and Jack Fishman Professor, has discovered several epigenetic mechanisms that normally keep stem cells in check but may be disrupted in cancer. Yadira Soto-Feliciano, a former postdoc in the lab who recently became an assistant professor at MIT, says this chain of events happens in pediatric cancers in particular.\nSoto-Feliciano wants to know how children\u2019s cancers differ from those affecting adults. Photo by Lori Chertoff.\nWhy pediatric cancers? And why are few adult cancers caused by these epigenetic mishaps? To answer these questions, Soto-Feliciano wants to know what else distinguishes a young person\u2019s cancer from that of an adult. Focusing on childhood blood cancers, she is pinpointing the mechanisms that mess up stem cells\u2019 epigenetic programming in the first place.\nRecently, she and Allis found a clue. They discovered that in pediatric leukemia, the initial disease culprit is a molecular machine that normally prevents malignant transformation by quieting certain genes in stem cells of the blood. A DNA rearrangement creates a riotous version of the machine that switches the genes on rather than off. Cancer ensues.\nIn her lab at MIT, she\u2019s looking for a way to free these trapped stem cells and help them grow out of their \u201cstemness\u201d; and she\u2019s exploring the possibility of developing new drugs based on that principle. The task may be accomplished by targeting the mutant machine with small molecules (several such molecules are currently in clinical trials for leukemia). But there is an additional layer of complexity: Soto-Feliciano has found that leukemia cells thrive not just by turning on growth-fueling genes, but also by shutting down other genes that normally suppress growth. She is now testing a combination therapy that, in addition to neutralizing the growth-fueling mutant, also switches suppressor genes back on, finishing off the cancerous cell once and for all.\n", "prompt": "Pinched between his thumb and forefinger, on a round sliver of glass no bigger than a potato chip, Ali H.

Brivanlou develops a microchip-based system to grow synthetic human embryos in culture.\nLearn more about these milestones in the story.\nIn the 1970s, a series of botched experiments led Howard Green, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to a surprise discovery. While unsuccessfully trying to replicate a rare cancer in a petri dish, Green noticed that the tumor-derived cells were forming structures resembling the outer layer of the skin, or epidermis. This \u201ctest-tube skin,\u201d as he called it, was so similar to real skin that it could be used for skin grafting. In an oft-cited procedure in 1983, Green and others regenerated massive amounts of epidermis and saved the lives of two boys whose bodies were covered with third-degree burns. But Green didn\u2019t know why his cultured cells could magically generate new tissue. What was going on inside that dish?\n50\u2013150Number of cells in an embryo five days after fertilization.\nEventually, he figured it out: Some of the cells had the capacity to divide over and over without specializing. Without these cells, now known as adult stem cells, no epidermal structures would grow.\nAdult stem cells can be found in virtually all the body\u2019s organs, where they live in localized homes called niches and self-generate to replenish the surrounding tissue. If it weren\u2019t for adult stem cells, these organs would wither and we wouldn\u2019t live long.\nElaine Fuchs was in graduate school when a lecture by Green upended her plans. Well on her way to becoming a microbiologist, she was so intrigued by the new discoveries that she switched gears and joined Green\u2019s lab as a postdoc. Today, four decades later, she continues to study epidermal stem cells, which have guided her to numerous discoveries in far-ranging fields, from inflammation to cancer.\nEpidermal stem cells (green) form small buds that might later develop into tumors. Photo by Robin Chemers Neustein Laboratory of Mammalian Cell Biology and Development.\nBecause stem cells continually exchange signals with their surroundings, Fuchs adds, all efforts to grow tissue in a dish begin with decoding the signals those cells use to communicate.\nIn the skin, specialized stem cells make the epidermis, hair follicles, and sweat glands; and in other organs like the intestines and lungs, different epithelial stem cell types regenerate similar absorptive layers. Bit by bit, Fuchs\u2019s lab is piecing together what goes on in the niches of these different stem cells, pinpointing the specialized microenvironments that nourish and guide them, and how those environments change in injury, inflammation, and cancer.\n\u201cIn the skin, there are 65 different cell types, and we believe a good number of them interact with stem cell niches in various ways and at different times,\u201d Fuchs says. Neurons, fibroblasts, adipocytes, muscle cells, and immune cells all communicate with skin stem cells to do the right thing at the right time. And recently, the lab discovered that the lymphatic vasculature wrapping around the niches synchronizes the activities of stem cells across a tissue. The dynamic interplay between stem cells and their niche is at the heart of the skin\u2019s routine maintenance and its ability to repair wounds, Fuchs says, and it also plays a role in many medical conditions\u2014enough to keep her lab perpetually busy.\nIn eavesdropping on stem cells in their niche, the lab has made several surprising discoveries. Among them is the fact that many chronic conditions traditionally considered immune disorders\u2014including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma\u2014might be the result not of a malfunctioning immune system but rather what happens when epithelial stem cells lose the ability to mount a robust barrier against pathogens or when they miscommunicate with the immune system. Moreover, Fuchs and her coworkers suspect that chronic inflammatory diseases may occur because stem cells harbor memories of past inflammatory episodes, causing them to react too quickly to a new trigger.\nEpithelial stem cells have led Fuchs to discoveries in far-ranging fields, from chronic inflammatory diseases to cancer. Photo by John Abbott.\nIt was Fuchs and her colleagues who discovered in 2017 that stem cells draw on their memories in responding to threats\u2014a process similar to immune cells\u2019 ability to remember a pathogen and respond more quickly on subsequent encounters. It\u2019s generally a useful adaptive mechanism that strengthens the body\u2019s defenses throughout life. The problem, Fuchs explains, is that repeated assaults might cause the cells to overreact to irritants or pathogens, leading to runaway inflammation that may manifest as rashes, pain, and other symptoms typically seen in these disorders. And her research suggests that stem cell memories are long-lasting: In a lab mouse, they can persist for up to six months, the equivalent of about five human years.\nCan these memories be erased? Fuchs thinks so, and her team is exploring this possibility. Ultimately, the researchers hope that their work will lead to the development of new treatments for chronic inflammatory conditions to replace current immunosuppressive drugs, which have undesirable side effects and are not always effective.\n1Number of epidermal stem cells needed to generate enough skin to cover the adult body.\n>200Number of cell types in the human body.\nThere are other circumstances in which adult stem cells trigger disease instead of healing and protecting their native tissue. One is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, a highly aggressive type of skin cancer that Fuchs and her coworkers have studied for many years.\nLike most of the body\u2019s tissues, healthy skin epithelium contains many mutant cells, which is usually not a problem. When a mutant shows up, neighboring cells will keep it in check by curbing its proliferation, for example\u2014and after a day or two, the cell will die. But if the mutant happens to be a stem cell, which is the case in squamous cell carcinoma, the scenario becomes far more dangerous. Because it can self-renew indefinitely, the stem cell will hold on to all the mutations it has gained in the past, building a vast repertoire of genetic errors and improving its chances of dodging the intrusive neighbors.\nHow does this cell dupe nearby cells, and how does it cut itself loose from its locale of origin to leak into the bloodstream and metastasize? \u201cThe epithelial stem cell has to manage to survive in order to give rise to cancer, and to do that it needs to change the way it communicates with other cells,\u201d Fuchs says.\n65Number of cell types in the skin.\n>1MNumber of stem-cell transplants performed to regenerate blood cells in patients.\nShe and her coworkers found that the mutant cell can create an escape route by generating stiffer surrounding tissue. As a result, mechanical forces build up, allowing the mutant to break through and pierce into deeper layers of the skin, from where it can spread further throughout the body via capillaries. More benign skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas, on the other hand, produce less rigid cell structures and are more likely to stay put.\nThe lab is now working to pinpoint which of the many mutations found in squamous cell carcinomas are responsible for hijacking the normal ability of epithelial stem cells to proliferate and heal wounds. \u201cFiguring this out will get us much closer to understanding how the disease advances and develop effective interventions,\u201d says Fuchs, the Rebecca C. Lancefield Professor.\nLike Fuchs, C. David Allis followed the science where it led him\u2014and became a cancer biologist along the way. A pioneer in the study of epigenetics, he began working in stem cells because they provide a convenient model, a cell-based system for studying an organism\u2019s entire genome in action.  Every part of their genome is flexible, allowing scientists to explore a vast universe of epigenetic programming taking place in development, dementia, depression, or your biological context of choice.\nWith his coworkers, Allis, who is Rockefeller\u2019s Joy and Jack Fishman Professor, has discovered several epigenetic mechanisms that normally keep stem cells in check but may be disrupted in cancer. Yadira Soto-Feliciano, a former postdoc in the lab who recently became an assistant professor at MIT, says this chain of events happens in pediatric cancers in particular.\nSoto-Feliciano wants to know how children\u2019s cancers differ from those affecting adults. Photo by Lori Chertoff.\nWhy pediatric cancers? And why are few adult cancers caused by these epigenetic mishaps? To answer these questions, Soto-Feliciano wants to know what else distinguishes a young person\u2019s cancer from that of an adult. Focusing on childhood blood cancers, she is pinpointing the mechanisms that mess up stem cells\u2019 epigenetic programming in the first place.\nRecently, she and Allis found a clue. They discovered that in pediatric leukemia, the initial disease culprit is a molecular machine that normally prevents malignant transformation by quieting certain genes in stem cells of the blood. A DNA rearrangement creates a riotous version of the machine that switches the genes on rather than off. Cancer ensues.\nIn her lab at MIT, she\u2019s looking for a way to free these trapped stem cells and help them grow out of their \u201cstemness\u201d; and she\u2019s exploring the possibility of developing new drugs based on that principle. The task may be accomplished by targeting the mutant machine with small molecules (several such molecules are currently in clinical trials for leukemia). But there is an additional layer of complexity: Soto-Feliciano has found that leukemia cells thrive not just by turning on growth-fueling genes, but also by shutting down other genes that normally suppress growth. She is now testing a combination therapy that, in addition to neutralizing the growth-fueling mutant, also switches suppressor genes back on, finishing off the cancerous cell once and for all.\n\nWrite a numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing:1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

Brivanlou holds 10,000 human embryos arranged in a neat grid. It has the look of something vaguely electronic, like the inner workings of a smartphone. Yet under more natural circumstances, each of these embryos, a cluster of cells nearly invisible to the naked eye, would have the potential to create something unmistakably organic\u2014a human being.\nThe lab\u2019s incubators contain dozens of these robotically created wafers. The one Brivanlou is holding is just a few hours old, and over the next few days, it will undergo a course of biochemical treatments mimicking signals from the womb. It will then be placed under a specialized microscope, allowing Brivanlou and his colleagues to record the 10,000 embryos\u2019 developmental journey.\nBut these embryos didn\u2019t start out as fertilized eggs, and they will never develop into fetuses. The cell clusters, called synthetic or artificial embryos, are the descendants of human embryonic stem cell lines derived in Brivanlou\u2019s lab 20 years ago.\nBeneath the beauty, there is promise. What makes embryonic stem cells unique is their ability to morph into almost any type of cell in the body, like muscle cell, nerve cell, or blood cell. And because of this spectacular power, known as pluripotency, they\u2019ve helped scientists forge countless new paths to discovery.\nFor example, stem cell research has delivered groundbreaking insights into the cryptic first stages of human development, and intriguing ideas about our evolutionary past. It has deepened our knowledge about the root causes of diseases like cancer, chronic inflammatory disorders, and degenerative conditions. Moreover, scientists are using stem cells as tools for a vast scope of work, from basic-science investigations of how the human genome is regulated to translational research seeking to pinpoint disease mechanisms or test novel drugs.\nToday it\u2019s hard to imagine where 21st-century science would be without stem cells, but their career as research subjects wasn\u2019t always smooth.\nIt was at the start of the new millennium that scientists learned how to grow embryonic stem cells in the lab and nudge the cells to take on new identities. The research attracted headlines partly because of controversy around how the cells were obtained\u2014typically from leftover embryos generated during in vitro fertilization treatment\u2014and partly because they held promise for regenerative medicine, the idea of using stem cells to replace diseased cells or tissues in patients. Some advocates of the science made increasingly optimistic projections: With the right technology, it would soon be possible to grow whole organs in petri dishes. A patient\u2019s worn-out liver, kidney, or heart could be swapped for a new one, like a set of tires.\n\u201cClaims were made about stem cells, particularly embryonic stem cells, that would clearly not be easy to fulfill,\u201d says Brivanlou, who is Rockefeller\u2019s Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Professor.\nBrivanlou uses synthetic embryos to answer longstanding questions about human development. Photo by Matthew Septimus.\nIndeed, working with human embryonic stem cells was challenging from the start, and remained difficult even after 2006, when new technologies allowed scientists to create so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by reprogramming somatic cells such as skin cells into an embryonic-like state. The iPSCs behaved similarly to stem cells derived from embryos and promised a limitless supply of pluripotent cells for research and medical applications, but they came with their own peculiarities and safety concerns. Scientists also developed methods to guide iPSCs or human embryonic stem cells to differentiate into slightly more mature cells called progenitors, but attempts to push them further, toward full specialization, kept failing. There were multiple challenges, starting with the fact that no developing cell operates in isolation\u2014to function normally, it must exchange signals with nearby cells and sometimes connect with nerves, arteries, and nonliving material in the tissue. It\u2019s a puzzle with so many pieces that its solution may still be decades away.\n50\u201370Number of times a normal human cell may divide before it starts to deteriorate.\n\u221eNumber of times a human stem cell may divide.\nThere were other hurdles, too. The creation of the first human embryonic stem cell line caused a cultural uproar so loud that it almost brought the science to a halt. Several European countries banned the creation of the cells, and in the United States, then president George W. Bush cut off the field\u2019s access to government funding. Scientists had to secure private funding for work involving embryonic stem cells and, to comply with federal regulations, erect physical barriers in their labs to separate privately funded work on stem cells from government-funded research.\nIt was in such a cordoned-off corner that Brivanlou\u2019s team began studying natural human embryos and deriving cell lines from them. They also developed a platform that made it possible to grow the embryos in petri dishes, even past day seven, when normal embryos need a uterus to survive. For the first time, they could watch the transformations taking place during the second week of human embryogenesis, up until around day 14. This is when a milestone called symmetry breaking occurs\u2014characterized by the emergence of the body\u2019s three axes (head to foot, front to back, left to right).\nTo observe later developmental stages, Brivanlou\u2019s lab and Rockefeller physicist Eric Siggia created synthetic human embryos growing as self-organizing 3D cultures. These embryo models mimic the geometry of natural embryos and can be induced to undergo symmetry breaking, giving researchers a way to study the biological events occurring in the third week of development. They have also provided some of the most striking pictures of early human life ever seen.\nWATCH: Ali H. Brivanlou on the ethics of studying human embryonic stem cells.\nCurrently, only a small fraction of embryos generated in fertility clinics are used for transfer to the uterus. Most are deemed deficient, flagged by a test detecting an abnormal number of chromosomes. But the team found that these supposedly nonviable embryos often self-correct as they grow, in a complex process that eliminates cells with irregular chromosome numbers from the fetus. These results are in line with earlier observations that when such abnormal embryos are implanted in a prospective parent, they survive just as often as embryos that test normal and produce healthy babies.\n\u201cThese embryos are viable and should no longer be discarded,\u201d Brivanlou says.\nMoreover, the synthetic embryos have created unprecedented opportunities for studying disease mechanisms and testing new drugs. One striking example is the lab\u2019s use of the technology to study Huntington\u2019s disease. This inherited neurodegenerative disorder was long thought to start in middle age, when symptoms typically emerge. But the researchers found that earlier signs of Huntington\u2019s arise before birth, in the first two weeks of embryonic development. \u201cThis suggests that what we\u2019ve long thought of as an age-related condition may in fact be a developmental disease,\u201d Brivanlou says.\nAnother technology that emerged from stem cell research is the organoid. From their human embryonic stem cell lines, Brivanlou and his colleagues created brain organoids\u2014tiny 3D cultures of embryonic neural tissue for studying Huntington\u2019s and screening for novel drugs. And when the pandemic hit, they created other organoids that model embryonic lung tissue, providing a system to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 damages airways and alveoli in people with severe COVID.\n\u201cThis technology really opens a door to identifying the mechanisms by which organs like the brain or lungs normally develop, understanding how they go awry in disease, and testing drugs that set these mechanisms back on the right course,\u201d says Brivanlou.\nGerman biologist Ernst Haeckel coins the term stamzelle (stem cell in German) describing the hypothetical ancestral cell from which all multicellular organisms evolved.\nGerman scientists Theodor Boveri and Valentin H\u00e4cker pronounce the stem cell the mother cell of the germ line, based on the theory that there is a common cell capable of self-renewal and differentiation.\nThe first allogeneic bone marrow transplant is performed in France, on survivors of a nuclear accident.

What I\u2019m trying to do now is use what I\u2019ve got to make a higher-res version. I\u2019ll put up the finished product in an edit. (I\u2019ll leave the current version though, as it\u2019s not very big.)\n\nWhat you\u2019re seeing here is one of the four elements the AI generated. There\u2019s text too, but I think it\u2019s not as obvious so I\u2019ll leave it out for now.\n\nHere\u2019s an idea I\u2019ve been looking at:\n\n 3D-printing the shapes the AI generates. I\u2019ve found a few 3D-printers on Amazon. And maybe the 3D-printers might be able to print the shapes better than my hands can. Also, it could be a way to make things I\u2019ve generated. What do you think? And the 3D-printing could be one of the ideas to be used. I\u2019ll do this in an edit, I think. And the one of the 3D-printed shapes I want to do is maybe the elephant. It could be the elephant I want to be printing. That I\u2019ve generated. And maybe the AI-generated thing is to be printed. And I\u2019m the elephant\u2019s trunk\u2019s what\u2019s that AI-generated thing\u2019s trunk. I\u2019ve taken to be the thing\u2019s trunk. It\u2019s an elephant.\n\nIt\u2019s the thing\u2019s trunk. And I can see the artificial lightbulbs. And the lightbulbs. I\u2019d never been seen. It\u2019s a sight. It\u2019s the eyes. I\u2019m as a lightbulb. And I almost never seen. I\u2019d almost near them to be to be seen.\n\n 40. It\u2019s a vision to be seen.\n\nIt\u2019s almost a lightbulb. It\u2019s the vision to the thing\u2019s hand.

The first is that it allows people to get in on the asset at a better price. Bear markets are necessary in order for traders and investors to make a profit. Many traders wait for these dips in price, looking for opportunities to make a value purchase. Depending on your investment time horizon, a Bitcoin price anywhere below $40,000 could present a good value.\nCryptocurrency markets are also known to be extremely volatile.

Market crashes can assist in weeding out low-quality and scam projects that don\u2019t bring anything to the table.\nThe drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value also allows people to take stock of their positions reevaluate their trading philosophy.

To my surprise, I realised that we can alter the code of the default Blogger Feed widget to accomodate our need to display recent comments in the layout. By simply manipulating the code, we can create a widget to display the name and a summary/full content of the 5 most recent comments posted to our blogs!\nComments are displayed in list format, and can automatically be styled to match the design of your blog.\nSo far, I have found only two disadvantages to using this method. Firstly, as this is based on a default feed widget, we can only display a maximum of 5 recent comments (the limitation applied by Blogger). Secondly, there is no way to display the title of the post commented on, as this information is not included in the code of the atom.xml feed.\nAt present, you would need to edit the contents of your Blogger template to add this new version of the \"recent comments\" widget due to current problems with Blogger's \"Add widget\" API. As soon as I am able to access the API successfully, I will work on a widget installer which will enable you to add this new widget with ease.\nFor now, here are the instructions to add this widget to your template by customizing your blog's HTML code.\nStep One: Back up your template!\nFirstly, you should make a full back-up of your existing template. This will enable you to restore your template to it's original composition if you accidentally make a mistake.\nTo make a back-up of your blog template, go to Layout>Edit HTML in your Blogger dashboard, and click the \"Download full template\" link near the top of the page.\nThis allows you to save a copy of your template to your computer as an XML file. Rename your template to help you find it easily, being sure to retain the \".xml\" extension.\nIn this step, we will add a complete widget (including the widget template) by adding HTML code.\nFor this, you will need to access the Edit HTML page for your Blogger template. Do not click the \"Expand widget templates\" box as this may make it more difficult for you to see where the code should be added.\nIf you cannot locate this exact section, find a line which begins with <b:section which references the \"class\" or \"ID\" of sidebar.\nThen preview your template. If you have made any errors in pasting this section of code, you will notice the error in your preview, or will receive an error message. If this is the case, click the \"Clear Edits\" link near the bottom of the page to revert your template back to normal, then begin again.\nOnce you have correctly pasted this code, save your template. At first you will not be able to see the recent comments widget appear in your blog layout. We need to add the URL for your comments feed and tweak a few options before the widget will appear.\nThe final step to adding this new recent comments widget is to add the Feed URL for your comments feed.\nTo do this, go to Layout>Page Elements where you should see a new \"Recent Comments\" feed appear at the top of your sidebar.\nYou need to add the URL of your blog's comment feed in the \"Feed URL\" box.\nYou should also tick at least the \"Item Sources/Authors\" box as this field will be used to display the commenter's name.\nOptionally, you could also tick the \"Item Dates\" option if you would prefer to display the date when comments were added.\nOnce you have added the URL to your comments feed and ticked the appropriate options, click the \"Save\" button and take a look at your blog. You should now see your new \"recent comments\" widget appear in your blog layout.\nWhen this widget is installed, you can move it around to a different part of your layout on the Layout>Page Elements page. As each entry of the comments feed is presented as a list item, the widget should take on the appearance of other list-type widgets in your layout.\nI hope this new version of the recent comments widget will be suitable for most needs and is easy to install in your Blogger template.

{"random_doc_file_path": "/home/eisape/projects/diversify_lm_output/dolma/data/v1_5r2_sample-0039.json.gz", "random_doc": "Studies have shown that opioid use is increasing across the country. Abuse is rampant, but so is the misapplication and over-prescribing of opioids by well-meaning physicians. We\u2019ve reviewed four recent papers which can help create a strategy for ED management of this ever-increasing \u2013 and often demanding \u2013 patient population.\nIncreasingly, emergency physicians are dealing with the misuse and abuse of opioids. Patients of all ages \u2014 presenting with acute, chronic or diverse etiologies of pain \u2014 are seeking help and treatment in the ED. The challenge of balancing the benefits and harms in opioid use can be daunting. In the last few months, four studies have been published that focused on this thorny problem of opioid use, as it relates to the elderly, pain relief, non-medical use and overdose death. Based on those studies, we\u2019ve included some practical suggestions for dealing with this thorny issue (see accompanying box).\nUsing a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, these authors reviewed opioid prescriptions filled by this cohort over a single calendar year. The hope was, of course, that, considering their elevated risks for adverse effects, the elderly would not be receiving undue quantities of opioids and that there was a single provider managing their prescription.\nThis study dashes those hopes. According to the research, about one-third of the elderly filled an opioid prescription over the course of the study period \u2013 with two-thirds receiving more than one prescription. Among those receiving more than one opioid prescription, less than half maintained continuity with a single provider. In fact, there was a group of about 143,000 beneficiaries who received a mean number of 15 opioid prescriptions from more than four different providers. Increased frequency of opioid receipt was, not surprisingly, associated with increased opioid-related hospitalization.\nSince this study is based solely on claims data, it may or may not be reasonable to conclude that an improper standard of care is at the root of the problem.\nOpioids are rarely the best answer for headache in the emergency department. While they offer some analgesic relief, they typically are not effective for treating migraines. Multiple other agents are preferred, and non-prescription agents are first-line abortive therapy.\nApparently, however, this message isn\u2019t getting out. This review of commercial health plan adolescents found that 48% of members with headache-related emergency department and primary care visits received prescriptions for opioids. Many of the individuals in this cohort did, however, have multiple visits to providers, and many tried other abortive therapies. Still, nearly 30% of those who received opioids ended up with more than three prescriptions in the one-year study period.\nThis survey of drug use describes the behavior of the 12 million individuals using opioids for non-medical purposes. A slight majority of the users were male, and most had annual incomes of less than $50,000 a year. According to the study, individuals who used opioids for non-medical reasons for fewer than 30 days out of the year obtained most of their opioids free from friends or relatives. However, as the frequency of use increased, users were increasingly likely to obtain their opioids from drug dealers \u2014 and physicians.\nThis study confirms that prescription drug abuse starts with physicians. Every single narcotic pill dispensed from a pharmacy \u2013 even if the initial indication is appropriate \u2013 becomes a possible precursor for abuse. This study also demonstrates the need for physicians to be acutely aware of quantities dispensed and the ultimate fate of leftover pills.\nOpioid misuse can, of course, be fatal. This snapshot of overdose deaths comes from Tennessee, where deaths increased from 422 to 1059 between 2003 and 2010. The authors also note, in the four-year period between 2007 and 2011, one-third of the population of Tennessee filled a prescription for opioids.\nThe researchers identified specific risk factors for more than half of the deaths based on three criteria. A patient filling opioid prescriptions from four or more prescribers, four or more pharmacies, or a daily average dose greater than 100 milligrams of morphine equivalence accounted for 55% of all overdose deaths. Physicians, particularly primary-care internal medicine and family medicine physicians were responsible for most of the increase in opioid prescribing. Hydrocodone and oxycodone were the most frequently prescribed, while methadone, oxymorphine and fentanyl were most associated with increased risk of death from overdose.\nJena AB, Goldman D, Weaver L, Karaca-Mandic P. Opioid prescribing by multiple providers in Medicare: retrospective observational study of insurance claims. BMJ. 2014 Feb 19;348:g1393.\nGreat article. I just have a concern about the statement that is quoted as saying that this study \u201cconfirms that prescription abuse starts with doctors\u201d. Addiction is a disease that some have predisposition to and while some doctors may be the initial fuse they are not the cause. Most patient have already been abusing prescription drugs from family members or they have had polysubstance abuse in the past. Physicians must take great care by limiting the amount prescribed, counseling patients on risk of abuse, and checking databases. The problem still exists that these patients don\u2019t have any viable alternative with no money going towards treatment of opiate dependency.\nI am to old to be subtle. For decades, physicians were accused of not adequately treating pain and were urged to use more opiates as they are generally considered safe and effective for pain management. Suddenly, government and academics are hot and bothered about drug use by our society where about half of our children are raised by single parent families, marijuana is legalized and cities are giving out heroin needles to save on the costs of HIV treatment. So now government has decided that physicians are over prescribing opiates. 143,000 Medicare patients receiving 15 prescriptions of opiates per year tell us nothing. Nearly 45 million people are on Medicare. Thus one in over 300 fits this profile. How many have cancer, how many are living with severe pain syndromes of one type or another. My own rheumatologist has suggested opiates for me for severe psoriatic arthritis. I refused because I personally prefer not live my life in a haze but that does not mean they are not indicated. How many of those Emergency Department scripts for opiates are for just 5 or so doses. In my former busy Emergency Department practice I used to see severe trauma or kidney stones every day. Were these not indications for opiates. And who says that opiates are not indicated for migraines that don\u2019t resolve with other medications. All of this commiserating about prescribing habits is just another example of a shotgun style attempt at government solutions for problems that government caused with other social solutions. Are there physicians who abuse their prescribing privileges? Are there patients who shop for narcotics. Of course there are. But there are also 5-10% of society who are alcoholic. to skewer the entire medical profession for inappropriate prescribing habits is ridiculous. The real question is why are so many members of our society needing these medications and why do third party carriers not adequately pay for ongoing counseling and psychotherapy. Fix those issues and you solve the problem.\nThe greatest issue is the current arena of \u201cpatient satisfaction.\u201d If you appropriately limit/withhold opiates (as I often do), the recipient of that measure complains to administration.

Abuse is rampant, but so is the misapplication and over-prescribing of opioids by well-meaning physicians. We\u2019ve reviewed four recent papers which can help create a strategy for ED management of this ever-increasing \u2013 and often demanding \u2013 patient population.\nIncreasingly, emergency physicians are dealing with the misuse and abuse of opioids. Patients of all ages \u2014 presenting with acute, chronic or diverse etiologies of pain \u2014 are seeking help and treatment in the ED. The challenge of balancing the benefits and harms in opioid use can be daunting. In the last few months, four studies have been published that focused on this thorny problem of opioid use, as it relates to the elderly, pain relief, non-medical use and overdose death. Based on those studies, we\u2019ve included some practical suggestions for dealing with this thorny issue (see accompanying box).\nUsing a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, these authors reviewed opioid prescriptions filled by this cohort over a single calendar year. The hope was, of course, that, considering their elevated risks for adverse effects, the elderly would not be receiving undue quantities of opioids and that there was a single provider managing their prescription.\nThis study dashes those hopes.

The gains came as the companies ended all litigation and signed new patent license deal and chip supply agreements targeting 5G iPhones.\nQualcomm\u2019s shares ended trading Wednesday at $79.04, compared with $57.18 on Monday -- when a federal jury trial began over antitrust and breach of contract legal claims between the tech firms where billions were at stake.\nThe share price rise equates to a $27 billion increase in market value for Qualcomm, pushing its market capitalization to $95 billion.\n\u201cThis settlement should ease investor fears that Qualcomm\u2019s (patent licensing) business model is threatened, as the company has now reached long-term deals with both Apple and Samsung, and we believe is making progress with Huawei,\u201d said Christopher Rolland, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group, in a research note.\nApple, which is larger than Qualcomm, saw its share price rise about 2 percent to $203.13 on news of the deal, which looks like it will pave the way for a 5G iPhone sometime in 2020.\n\u201cQualcomm\u2019s strong research and development investments and leadership in 5G modems was a key factor in Apple reaching a settlement,\u201d said Mike Walkley, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity.\nWith opening statements in the trial underway, Qualcomm and Apple announced Tuesday that they reached a settlement. Apple signed a six-year, direct license to Qualcomm\u2019s patents with a two-year renewal option. The two companies also agreed to a chip supply deal.

How do you expect to be able to get around Bangkok without a map app? How hard would life be without translation apps? And could you imagine having to do all of your banking in person when the procedures and processes Thai banks follow vary from day to day and branch to branch?\nYou can do amazing things with a modern mobile phone and a good data plan. In fact, you can manage your entire expat existence from a small touch screen, from working to invoicing to transferring money overseas to paying bills to ordering food. That being the case, it\u2019s essential that you select the best data plan for you.\nWhat do you want from a good data plan in Thailand?\nPhone service providers in Thailand - as with anywhere else in the world - will often pad out their plans with a lot of extras to make their offer seem like an especially good deal. However, all you really need is a fast internet connection and as much data as you can realistically use in a month (plus a little extra for emergencies). Precisely how much data that is depends on your habits and requirements.\nIt\u2019s useful to bear in mind that the vast majority of common uses for the internet are actually quite light on data. Sending emails, loading web pages and online banking all use extremely little data, unless you\u2019re sending large attachments. The biggest data hog will generally be streaming high-definition video.\nThe packages offered by Thailand\u2019s leading companies usually include a bunch of free minutes and text messages. Do people still make hundreds of minutes of phone calls instead of using free VOIP services like Messenger, LINE, WhatsApp, FaceTime or Skype? There will be those whose businesses are heavily reliant on phone calls, so this addition might not be completely useless, though it perhaps takes a lower priority to such details as the amount of unused data you can roll over to the next month.\nSome of the added bonuses can be quite helpful. Some packages include overseas data roaming - very helpful if you travel around a lot for work. Others include a Netflix subscription and a free copy of the mobile version of Player Unknown\u2019s Battlegrounds - very useful if your job gives you a lot of free time.\nWhat data plans do AIS offer?\nAIS (which stands for Advanced Info Services) is the single largest mobile phone company in Thailand, mostly by virtue of having pioneered many of the technological leaps in mobile technology, though also through a number of shrewd deals and buyouts. AIS operate over 100,000 free Wi-Fi hotspots around Thailand, which can help to make your data plan stretch a little further.\nThe main packages available from AIS are tailored to different types of user. The NEXT G Flexi Speed package comes in three price tiers offering different amounts of 3G/4G data.\nIf you manage to use all of your 3G/4G allowance for the month, you will still have internet access, but at a much reduced rate of 384 kbps for those paying 750 baht and just 256 kbps for those paying less. All tiers get 200 minutes of call time.\nAs the name implies, the speed of your internet connection is also flexible and can be adjusted according to your needs, though this does not alter the cost of the package. That being the case, the purpose seems to be just to help incorrigible internet users ration their usage to make their data allowance last the full month.\nAIS also offers the NEXT G Max Speed package, which focuses more on entertainment than anything else. Given the need for a rapid internet connection when streaming video or playing online games, this makes a lot of sense, though the fast connection could potentially have business applications.\nThere are eight tiers of this package, ranging in price from 499 baht per month up to 1,999 baht per month. They all come with a three-month subscription to Netflix, HBO and Warner Brothers TV and a 12-month subscription to PUBG M. The main differences between them are the amount of data and the amount of call minutes. At 1,099 baht per month and above, the 3G/4G data becomes unlimited and you\u2019re up to 700 minutes of call time per month. At the very top end of the scale, you hit 2,000 minutes. You would need to be on the phone for over an hour each day to use it all in one month!\nAdvantages to using AIS: Packages include a lot of data for a good price.\nDisadvantages to using AIS: Unlimited data is not available without the gimmicky extras.\nWhat data plans do True offer?\nTrueMove H is the mobile subsidiary of the enormous True Corporation, which has fingers in virtually every communications and digital services pie in Thailand, from TV channels to banking. They even own the Bangkok United Football Club. After AIS, True are the second largest mobile service provider in the country.\nTrue have very specifically tuned packages which focus on providing the lowest possible cost for particular types of users. Their U-Max package, for example, is aimed at university students. It offers free data for social media apps including Facebook, Instagram, LINE, Twitter and TikTok. Addressing the aforementioned fact that kids don\u2019t really use the \u2018phone\u2019 part of their phone anymore, instead favouring VOIP services like LINE, these packages come with no free minutes. There are three price tiers available.\nProbably True\u2019s best package is the 4G+ Super Net Unlimited, which boasts the \u201cfastest speed with most data\u201d. The speed is the standard for 4G - about 300 Mbps, which all 4G providers offer. As for the amount, there are six packages available ranging from a poultry 3 GB of data for 299 baht per month up to unlimited data for 1,099 baht per month, though the limitless data only lasts for the first 12 months. Again, none of the packages offer call time, instead boasting a pay-per-second rate of 1.80 baht per minute.\nAdvantages to using True: Unlimited data on social apps reflects typical phone usage.\nDisadvantages to using True: Unlimited data is only unlimited for a year.\nWhat data plans do dTac offer?\ndTac\u2019s name rather bizarrely means \u201cTotal Access Communication\u201d, with no explanation given for the \u201cd\u201d. They possess about a third of the Thai mobile market, making them the third largest provider in the country. The company belongs to the Norwegian-owned Telenor Group - one of the largest telecom companies in the world - and shares the same logo.\nWhat helps dTac to really stand out from the competition is the addition of international data roaming in their packages - no doubt a result of dTac belonging to such a world-spanning organisation. The standard dTac GO package comes in eight price tiers, with steadily increasing amounts of call time, data and countries where 5 GB of data is free.\nWhere dTac compares less favourably against its rivals is the choice of packages. The GO package is effectively the only post-paid option available, other than tariffs designed specifically for tablets.\nAdvantages to using dTac: Free data available in up to 72 countries worldwide, removing the need to buy a local SIM card when travelling.\nDisadvantages to using dTac: Poor choice of packages and extras.\nWhich is the best mobile data plan in Thailand?\nWhen picking the right mobile data plan for you, the first thing to calculate is how much data you will actually use. According to research, people in the Asia Pacific region currently use about 3.3 GB per month, but that\u2019s expected to rise to 26 GB per month by 2024. Since that\u2019s an awkward number to work with, we\u2019ll round it down to 20 GB per month.\nIf this is the case, the clear winner is True. While the U-Max package may be primarily aimed at students, the fact that it provides 20 GB of 3G/4G data per month and free data on popular social media apps, all at the lowest price among its competitors, makes it an excellent choice.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s safe to completely discount dTac and AIS. For starters, these two companies have the best service coverage around Thailand, so they can connect in places which True can\u2019t reach. However, if you\u2019re mostly going to be in and around the major tourist and expat hubs like Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Pattaya and others, this difference will be barely noticeable. On the other hand, the bonus features they offer - free data roaming overseas and comprehensive entertainment packages - do make them worth a second glance and, if that kind of thing particularly appeals to you, perhaps also a few more baht.", "prompt": "A smartphone with a data plan is about as essential to modern life as food, shelter and clothing, particularly in Thailand.

At 1,099 baht per month and above, the 3G/4G data becomes unlimited and you\u2019re up to 700 minutes of call time per month. At the very top end of the scale, you hit 2,000 minutes. You would need to be on the phone for over an hour each day to use it all in one month!\nAdvantages to using AIS: Packages include a lot of data for a good price.\nDisadvantages to using AIS: Unlimited data is not available without the gimmicky extras.\nWhat data plans do True offer?\nTrueMove H is the mobile subsidiary of the enormous True Corporation, which has fingers in virtually every communications and digital services pie in Thailand, from TV channels to banking. They even own the Bangkok United Football Club. After AIS, True are the second largest mobile service provider in the country.\nTrue have very specifically tuned packages which focus on providing the lowest possible cost for particular types of users. Their U-Max package, for example, is aimed at university students. It offers free data for social media apps including Facebook, Instagram, LINE, Twitter and TikTok. Addressing the aforementioned fact that kids don\u2019t really use the \u2018phone\u2019 part of their phone anymore, instead favouring VOIP services like LINE, these packages come with no free minutes. There are three price tiers available.\nProbably True\u2019s best package is the 4G+ Super Net Unlimited, which boasts the \u201cfastest speed with most data\u201d. The speed is the standard for 4G - about 300 Mbps, which all 4G providers offer. As for the amount, there are six packages available ranging from a poultry 3 GB of data for 299 baht per month up to unlimited data for 1,099 baht per month, though the limitless data only lasts for the first 12 months. Again, none of the packages offer call time, instead boasting a pay-per-second rate of 1.80 baht per minute.\nAdvantages to using True: Unlimited data on social apps reflects typical phone usage.\nDisadvantages to using True: Unlimited data is only unlimited for a year.\nWhat data plans do dTac offer?\ndTac\u2019s name rather bizarrely means \u201cTotal Access Communication\u201d, with no explanation given for the \u201cd\u201d. They possess about a third of the Thai mobile market, making them the third largest provider in the country. The company belongs to the Norwegian-owned Telenor Group - one of the largest telecom companies in the world - and shares the same logo.\nWhat helps dTac to really stand out from the competition is the addition of international data roaming in their packages - no doubt a result of dTac belonging to such a world-spanning organisation. The standard dTac GO package comes in eight price tiers, with steadily increasing amounts of call time, data and countries where 5 GB of data is free.\nWhere dTac compares less favourably against its rivals is the choice of packages. The GO package is effectively the only post-paid option available, other than tariffs designed specifically for tablets.\nAdvantages to using dTac: Free data available in up to 72 countries worldwide, removing the need to buy a local SIM card when travelling.\nDisadvantages to using dTac: Poor choice of packages and extras.\nWhich is the best mobile data plan in Thailand?\nWhen picking the right mobile data plan for you, the first thing to calculate is how much data you will actually use. According to research, people in the Asia Pacific region currently use about 3.3 GB per month, but that\u2019s expected to rise to 26 GB per month by 2024. Since that\u2019s an awkward number to work with, we\u2019ll round it down to 20 GB per month.\nIf this is the case, the clear winner is True. While the U-Max package may be primarily aimed at students, the fact that it provides 20 GB of 3G/4G data per month and free data on popular social media apps, all at the lowest price among its competitors, makes it an excellent choice.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s safe to completely discount dTac and AIS. For starters, these two companies have the best service coverage around Thailand, so they can connect in places which True can\u2019t reach. However, if you\u2019re mostly going to be in and around the major tourist and expat hubs like Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Pattaya and others, this difference will be barely noticeable. On the other hand, the bonus features they offer - free data roaming overseas and comprehensive entertainment packages - do make them worth a second glance and, if that kind of thing particularly appeals to you, perhaps also a few more baht.\nWrite a numbered list of 100 new research projects in natural language processing:1. diversyfying the open source language model output 2.

Finding correlation between the human brain and language models 3. ", "full_output": "A smartphone with a data plan is about as essential to modern life as food, shelter and clothing, particularly in Thailand. How do you expect to be able to get around Bangkok without a map app? How hard would life be without translation apps? And could you imagine having to do all of your banking in person when the procedures and processes Thai banks follow vary from day to day and branch to branch?\nYou can do amazing things with a modern mobile phone and a good data plan. In fact, you can manage your entire expat existence from a small touch screen, from working to invoicing to transferring money overseas to paying bills to ordering food. That being the case, it\u2019s essential that you select the best data plan for you.\nWhat do you want from a good data plan in Thailand?\nPhone service providers in Thailand - as with anywhere else in the world - will often pad out their plans with a lot of extras to make their offer seem like an especially good deal. However, all you really need is a fast internet connection and as much data as you can realistically use in a month (plus a little extra for emergencies). Precisely how much data that is depends on your habits and requirements.\nIt\u2019s useful to bear in mind that the vast majority of common uses for the internet are actually quite light on data. Sending emails, loading web pages and online banking all use extremely little data, unless you\u2019re sending large attachments. The biggest data hog will generally be streaming high-definition video.\nThe packages offered by Thailand\u2019s leading companies usually include a bunch of free minutes and text messages. Do people still make hundreds of minutes of phone calls instead of using free VOIP services like Messenger, LINE, WhatsApp, FaceTime or Skype? There will be those whose businesses are heavily reliant on phone calls, so this addition might not be completely useless, though it perhaps takes a lower priority to such details as the amount of unused data you can roll over to the next month.\nSome of the added bonuses can be quite helpful. Some packages include overseas data roaming - very helpful if you travel around a lot for work. Others include a Netflix subscription and a free copy of the mobile version of Player Unknown\u2019s Battlegrounds - very useful if your job gives you a lot of free time.\nWhat data plans do AIS offer?\nAIS (which stands for Advanced Info Services) is the single largest mobile phone company in Thailand, mostly by virtue of having pioneered many of the technological leaps in mobile technology, though also through a number of shrewd deals and buyouts. AIS operate over 100,000 free Wi-Fi hotspots around Thailand, which can help to make your data plan stretch a little further.\nThe main packages available from AIS are tailored to different types of user. The NEXT G Flexi Speed package comes in three price tiers offering different amounts of 3G/4G data.\nIf you manage to use all of your 3G/4G allowance for the month, you will still have internet access, but at a much reduced rate of 384 kbps for those paying 750 baht and just 256 kbps for those paying less. All tiers get 200 minutes of call time.\nAs the name implies, the speed of your internet connection is also flexible and can be adjusted according to your needs, though this does not alter the cost of the package. That being the case, the purpose seems to be just to help incorrigible internet users ration their usage to make their data allowance last the full month.\nAIS also offers the NEXT G Max Speed package, which focuses more on entertainment than anything else. Given the need for a rapid internet connection when streaming video or playing online games, this makes a lot of sense, though the fast connection could potentially have business applications.\nThere are eight tiers of this package, ranging in price from 499 baht per month up to 1,999 baht per month. They all come with a three-month subscription to Netflix, HBO and Warner Brothers TV and a 12-month subscription to PUBG M. The main differences between them are the amount of data and the amount of call minutes. At 1,099 baht per month and above, the 3G/4G data becomes unlimited and you\u2019re up to 700 minutes of call time per month. At the very top end of the scale, you hit 2,000 minutes.

Give examples of where NLP is being used, and how it is helping to improve human lives.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges in NLP? Why do we still need to improve our ability to understand and process human language?\n\nNLP is the study of how to extract meaning from natural language. NLP aims to develop systems that can process natural language with human-like ability. Natural language is the form of communication that humans use to communicate with one another. It includes not only spoken or written language, but also gesture and touch. Natural language processing involves the use of computers to process natural language and extract meaning from it. NLP is an interdisciplinary field, drawing on work from many areas, including linguistics, artificial intelligence, psychology, and cognitive science.\n\nThere are many different types of NLP, and many different approaches to NLP. Some of the most common types of NLP are information retrieval, information extraction, machine translation, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. Information retrieval refers to the process of extracting useful information from unstructured data (such as text). This is often used to find relevant information on the internet. Information extraction refers to the process of extracting structured data from unstructured text. This can be used to extract structured data from documents, such as a list of names and addresses. Machine translation is the process of converting text from one language to another. Speech recognition is the process of identifying words spoken by humans. Sentiment analysis is the process of extracting opinions and emotions from text.\n\nThere are many challenges in NLP.
