Just think about how much it would cost your company to give each user a decent printer. With Linux, it\u2019s even better! Linux offers an ideal environment for sharing printers over a cross-platform network that includes Windows and Macintosh systems and Linux boxes. If you use Linux, you won\u2019t have to fork over a lot of money for commercial applications and hardware that you don\u2019t need. Why pay for a pricey HP DirectJet print server, when Linux can do the job for free? Still, many people pay for DirectJet-equipped printers because they work very well on heterogeneous networks in which Linux, UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh users need to access printing services. As you\u2019ll learn in this Daily Drill Down, however, Linux can perform this job just as effectively.\nIn this two-part series, I\u2019ll explain how you can make your printers accessible to all of the users of your network, including those who use Linux, Windows, and Macintosh machines. This week, I\u2019ll show you how to implement printer sharing in the native Linux environment. Next time, I\u2019ll discuss Windows and Macintosh users. I\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019ve already installed at least one printer on your Linux system successfully and that it\u2019s working just fine. If you haven\u2019t done so, install one now! Most of today\u2019s Linux distributions come with reasonably user-friendly printer configuration utilities, such as Red Hat\u2019s printtool. If you\u2019re using a distribution other than Red Hat, check your distribution\u2019s documentation and find out how to install a printer on your system.\nAlthough some Linux distributions offer alternative printer interfaces, the most common one is the Line Printing Daemon (lpd). Derived from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) daemon of the same name, lpd waits until printer services are needed. When an application requests printing services, lpd springs into action. It writes the print output file to a temporary storage area in /var/spool/lpd. Then, it locates the printer and parcels out the print output at a pace that the printer can handle. If lpd receives additional printing requests before the first job is finished, the daemon creates a print queue, a list of files that are waiting to print. Since different printers have different characteristics, how does lpd know how to print the file? The answer lies in /etc/printcap, the lpd configuration file. In this file, you\u2019ll find one or more stanzas, which are blocks of configuration commands that look like the stanzas of a poem. Each stanza defines a specific printer and provides such information as how the printer is connected to the computer and which filter should be used. A filter is a file that\u2019s unique to each brand and model of printer. It defines a printer\u2019s characteristics and capabilities.\nJust remember that lpd is a network service. This fact is true even if you\u2019re using Linux as a standalone, single-user workstation. When an application needs lpd\u2019s services, it routes a request through TCP/IP. Thus, if a local application can request services from a local copy of lpd, then any application on the network can do the same thing. If you configure the server and clients correctly, network printing becomes completely transparent to the user.\nIf you\u2019re coming to Linux from a Windows networking background, you might assume that it\u2019s necessary to implement Network File System (NFS) services on the server or clients in order to share printers on the network. With Windows, both network printing and file sharing are implemented within the same huge, complex protocol, which is called Server Message Blocks (SMB). But that\u2019s not how Linux works. In keeping with their UNIX heritage, Linux utilities are smaller, more focused, and, consequently, less buggy. NFS handles file sharing in a way that\u2019s totally independent of printer sharing. Likewise, lpd handles printer sharing without using or needing NFS.\nOn the server, you need to create user accounts for each user who will be accessing the printer remotely. You also need to create a configuration file named /etc/hosts.lpd. This file will contain the aliases or IP addresses of the workstations that can access the printer.\nOn each client, you\u2019ll need to add a stanza to /etc/printcap that specifies the printer\u2019s characteristics and indicates where the printer is located. You can use your Linux distribution\u2019s printer configuration tool, or you can configure the /etc/printcap file on each of the client systems manually.\nFirst, let\u2019s focus on the server, the computer to which the printer is attached. To prepare the server for printer sharing, you must make sure that the printer is working properly on the machine to which it\u2019s connected. Now, make sure that each user who will be accessing this printer has an account on the machine to which the computer is connected. This account must be identical to the one on the user\u2019s system. If you plan on using NFS, make sure that the accounts are identical to the last detail: username, user numerical ID (UID), primary group membership, and primary group numerical ID (GID).\nFinally, you can save the file and exit.\nIf you\u2019ve read some of the really ancient documentation that\u2019s out there on the Internet, you may think that the proper configuration file is called /etc/hosts.equiv. Do not create or use any file by this name! It\u2019s a security hole that\u2019s about the same size as the Grand Canyon. Basically, hosts.equiv lists the computers that should have totally unrestricted access to the server. Granting such access isn\u2019t a very good idea, even on a small network where everyone trusts each other and nobody would harm anyone else\u2019s system intentionally. But accidents happen, and when they happen, you should try to keep them from happening to all of the systems on your network. On a large network\u2014especially on a network that\u2019s connected to the Internet\u2014using hosts.equiv is an open invitation to disaster. Instead, use hosts.lpd, which was developed to enable network printer access but doesn\u2019t entail the risks that are involved with hosts.equiv.\nLog in as the root user and start your printer configuration utility. To run printtool on a Red Hat or Red Hat-derived system, switch to superuser, type /usr/sbin/printtool, and press [Enter]. You\u2019ll see the Red Hat Linux Print System Manager.\nClick Add to create a new printer profile. You\u2019ll see the Add a Printer Entry dialog box.\nClick Remove Unix (lpd) Queue and click OK. You\u2019ll see the Edit Remote Unix (lpd) Queue Entry dialog box.\nIn the Names area, type one or more names for the printer, separated by vertical bar characters (|). If the utility proposed a name, you may use it.\nIn the Spool directory area, accept the proposed directory name. Note that each client will have its own local print spool for the remote printer.\nIn the Remote Host area, type the IP address of the computer to which the printer is connected.\nIn the Remote Queue area, type the name of the remote printer\u2019s queue. If only one printer is defined on the remote system, type lp. If the remote system\u2019s /etc/printcap file defines more than one printer, open this file and determine the name of the printer\u2019s queue (such as lp0, lp1, or lp2).\nClick Input Filter and select the computer type from the list. If your printer isn\u2019t on the list but it works with PostScript, choose PostScript Printer. Click OK to exit the input filters list.\nClick OK to confirm the network printer settings, which are saved in the form of a new stanza that\u2019s added to /etc/printcap. If you\u2019re using a printer configuration utility other than Red Hat\u2019s printtool, make sure that the configuration settings are saved.\nClick Tests on the menu bar and choose Print PostScript test page. Make sure that the printer prints the page.\nRepeat the above steps on all of the client machines on your network. If you run into problems getting one of the clients to access the remote printer, the problem almost certainly rests with the user\u2019s account on the server, the server\u2019s /etc/hosts.lpd file, or a simple typing error.\nA stanza must be expressed on a single line. Since they would be almost unreadable otherwise, you can break up the line by inserting backslashes. If the printer isn\u2019t working correctly, make sure that each line of the stanza (except for the last line, of course) ends in a backslash.\nColons delimit the various parts of the stanza.\nThe first line names the printer and provides aliases in a list that\u2019s separated by vertical bars.\nSome variables are yes/no, on/off, Boolean variables. They\u2019re turned on automatically if they\u2019re present in the file.\nOther variables are assignment variables, and they require an equals sign (for example, sd=/var/spool/lpd/lp). Still others are numeric variables, and they require the numeric operator (#), as in mx#0.\nThe printer named lp is the default printer. Additional printers are named lp0, lp1, lp2, etc.\nThe sd variable specifies the location of the printer\u2019s spool directory. Although the stanza accesses a remote printer, the spool is stored locally (/var/spool/lpd/lp).\nThe mx variable specifies the maximum permissible size (in blocks) of the file to be printed. To allow any size file to be printed, use mx=#0.\nThe sh variable (if present) suppresses header printing. The header indicates the job name and the source of the printout. If you\u2019re configuring a printer for use on a large network with many users, you may wish to print the headers so that an attendant can sort the print jobs.\nThe rm variable specifies the location of the remote printer. You can use an alias (such as luke) or an IP address (such as  |||IP_ADDRESS||| ).\nThe rp variable specifies the name of the remote printer\u2019s queue. Set this variable to the printer\u2019s name as defined in the server\u2019s /etc/printcap file. If the remote printer is named lp0 in the server\u2019s /etc/printcap file, the print queue name is lp0, too.\nThe if variable specifies the location of the print filter that will be used with the printer in question.\nIn the next Drill Down in this series, I\u2019ll tell you how to make your printer accessible to Windows and Mac users on your network. To do so, you must use a reasonably well-documented package called Samba, a Linux implementation of the Windows networking protocols. You also must use a relatively unknown package called netatalk, which enables Macintosh users to access Linux files and printers. Afterwards, you\u2019ll know how to implement printer sharing for all three platforms, a trick that you couldn\u2019t pull off otherwise without spending lots of money on commercial applications.

If you configure the server and clients correctly, network printing becomes completely transparent to the user.\nIf you\u2019re coming to Linux from a Windows networking background, you might assume that it\u2019s necessary to implement Network File System (NFS) services on the server or clients in order to share printers on the network. With Windows, both network printing and file sharing are implemented within the same huge, complex protocol, which is called Server Message Blocks (SMB). But that\u2019s not how Linux works. In keeping with their UNIX heritage, Linux utilities are smaller, more focused, and, consequently, less buggy. NFS handles file sharing in a way that\u2019s totally independent of printer sharing. Likewise, lpd handles printer sharing without using or needing NFS.\nOn the server, you need to create user accounts for each user who will be accessing the printer remotely. You also need to create a configuration file named /etc/hosts.lpd. This file will contain the aliases or IP addresses of the workstations that can access the printer.\nOn each client, you\u2019ll need to add a stanza to /etc/printcap that specifies the printer\u2019s characteristics and indicates where the printer is located. You can use your Linux distribution\u2019s printer configuration tool, or you can configure the /etc/printcap file on each of the client systems manually.\nFirst, let\u2019s focus on the server, the computer to which the printer is attached. To prepare the server for printer sharing, you must make sure that the printer is working properly on the machine to which it\u2019s connected. Now, make sure that each user who will be accessing this printer has an account on the machine to which the computer is connected. This account must be identical to the one on the user\u2019s system. If you plan on using NFS, make sure that the accounts are identical to the last detail: username, user numerical ID (UID), primary group membership, and primary group numerical ID (GID).\nFinally, you can save the file and exit.\nIf you\u2019ve read some of the really ancient documentation that\u2019s out there on the Internet, you may think that the proper configuration file is called /etc/hosts.equiv. Do not create or use any file by this name! It\u2019s a security hole that\u2019s about the same size as the Grand Canyon. Basically, hosts.equiv lists the computers that should have totally unrestricted access to the server. Granting such access isn\u2019t a very good idea, even on a small network where everyone trusts each other and nobody would harm anyone else\u2019s system intentionally. But accidents happen, and when they happen, you should try to keep them from happening to all of the systems on your network. On a large network\u2014especially on a network that\u2019s connected to the Internet\u2014using hosts.equiv is an open invitation to disaster. Instead, use hosts.lpd, which was developed to enable network printer access but doesn\u2019t entail the risks that are involved with hosts.equiv.\nLog in as the root user and start your printer configuration utility. To run printtool on a Red Hat or Red Hat-derived system, switch to superuser, type /usr/sbin/printtool, and press [Enter]. You\u2019ll see the Red Hat Linux Print System Manager.\nClick Add to create a new printer profile. You\u2019ll see the Add a Printer Entry dialog box.\nClick Remove Unix (lpd) Queue and click OK. You\u2019ll see the Edit Remote Unix (lpd) Queue Entry dialog box.\nIn the Names area, type one or more names for the printer, separated by vertical bar characters (|). If the utility proposed a name, you may use it.\nIn the Spool directory area, accept the proposed directory name. Note that each client will have its own local print spool for the remote printer.\nIn the Remote Host area, type the IP address of the computer to which the printer is connected.\nIn the Remote Queue area, type the name of the remote printer\u2019s queue. If only one printer is defined on the remote system, type lp. If the remote system\u2019s /etc/printcap file defines more than one printer, open this file and determine the name of the printer\u2019s queue (such as lp0, lp1, or lp2).\nClick Input Filter and select the computer type from the list. If your printer isn\u2019t on the list but it works with PostScript, choose PostScript Printer. Click OK to exit the input filters list.\nClick OK to confirm the network printer settings, which are saved in the form of a new stanza that\u2019s added to /etc/printcap. If you\u2019re using a printer configuration utility other than Red Hat\u2019s printtool, make sure that the configuration settings are saved.\nClick Tests on the menu bar and choose Print PostScript test page. Make sure that the printer prints the page.\nRepeat the above steps on all of the client machines on your network. If you run into problems getting one of the clients to access the remote printer, the problem almost certainly rests with the user\u2019s account on the server, the server\u2019s /etc/hosts.lpd file, or a simple typing error.\nA stanza must be expressed on a single line. Since they would be almost unreadable otherwise, you can break up the line by inserting backslashes. If the printer isn\u2019t working correctly, make sure that each line of the stanza (except for the last line, of course) ends in a backslash.\nColons delimit the various parts of the stanza.\nThe first line names the printer and provides aliases in a list that\u2019s separated by vertical bars.\nSome variables are yes/no, on/off, Boolean variables. They\u2019re turned on automatically if they\u2019re present in the file.\nOther variables are assignment variables, and they require an equals sign (for example, sd=/var/spool/lpd/lp). Still others are numeric variables, and they require the numeric operator (#), as in mx#0.\nThe printer named lp is the default printer. Additional printers are named lp0, lp1, lp2, etc.\nThe sd variable specifies the location of the printer\u2019s spool directory. Although the stanza accesses a remote printer, the spool is stored locally (/var/spool/lpd/lp).\nThe mx variable specifies the maximum permissible size (in blocks) of the file to be printed. To allow any size file to be printed, use mx=#0.\nThe sh variable (if present) suppresses header printing. The header indicates the job name and the source of the printout. If you\u2019re configuring a printer for use on a large network with many users, you may wish to print the headers so that an attendant can sort the print jobs.\nThe rm variable specifies the location of the remote printer. You can use an alias (such as luke) or an IP address (such as  |||IP_ADDRESS||| ).\nThe rp variable specifies the name of the remote printer\u2019s queue. Set this variable to the printer\u2019s name as defined in the server\u2019s /etc/printcap file. If the remote printer is named lp0 in the server\u2019s /etc/printcap file, the print queue name is lp0, too.\nThe if variable specifies the location of the print filter that will be used with the printer in question.\nIn the next Drill Down in this series, I\u2019ll tell you how to make your printer accessible to Windows and Mac users on your network. To do so, you must use a reasonably well-documented package called Samba, a Linux implementation of the Windows networking protocols. You also must use a relatively unknown package called netatalk, which enables Macintosh users to access Linux files and printers. Afterwards, you\u2019ll know how to implement printer sharing for all three platforms, a trick that you couldn\u2019t pull off otherwise without spending lots of money on commercial applications. So, until then, have fun. And don\u2019t wear out your printer too quickly!\n\nThe United States of America (USA), also known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America.

In addition to being home to some of the most famous tourist destinations in the world, the U.S. is also home to some of the world\u2019s most powerful and prosperous companies.\n\nOne of the primary differences between the different sections of America is the type of government and the system of governance that each state possesses. Generally in most states, the government is divided into three branches: the state government, the neighborhood government, and the federal government. Each of these branches is made up of various departments and agencies that focus on specific functions and are headed by a cabinet member, the governor of every state, and the chief executive officer (CEA) of every department. The CEA, which is the highest ranking official in a department, is usually a member of the President\u2019s Cabinet and is known as the chief executive officer of the department.\n\nThe federal government is divided into three branches \u2013 the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. Each branch has its own set of powers and responsibilities. These powers and responsibilities include: enforcing federal laws; proposing federal budget bills for approval by the house and senate; vetoing bills passed by the state legislature; creating and implementing national foreign policy; and appointing the members of the U.S. Supreme Court and other federal courts. Each department includes a variety of officers who serve different functions, including: Secretary of State, who enforces foreign policy and makes appointments to U.S. embassies around the world; Secretary of Defense, who manages all U.S. military installations and activities; Secretary of Homeland Security, who oversees U.S. border security; Attorney General, who enforces the law; Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who supervises government-owned housing; and Secretary of Education, who manages federal education funding.

The Forum was moderated by NYLCVEF President Julie Tighe and environmental panelists included Adrienne Esposito from Citizens Campaign for the Environment, Eric Alexander from Vision Long Island, and Mariah Dignan from Climate Jobs NY.\nEd Smyth is a practicing lawyer in the Town of Huntington, a US Marine Staff Sergeant veteran, and serves as a Councilman on the Huntingtown Board following his election in 2017. Smyth is running on a platform of continued investment in green infrastructure, concerned primarily with insufficient sewer systems in the Town and poor water quality. He also holds deep concerns about solid waste management on Long Island and the closing of the Brookhaven Landfill in 2024, and the lack of economically or environmentally sound methods of transporting ash waste off of Long Island. In response to this, he intends to implement measures to reduce solid waste by tonnage, increase recycling, and implement organic recycling streams.\nWhen asked about the issue of affordable housing in his constituency, Smyth answered that he would shift from the current system of requiring 20% of new developments to be priced as affordable housing, to instead selling all units at market value and putting the difference in profit margins into an affordable housing trust fund in an effort to increase homeownership. He also intends to upgrade the sewage treatment plan and minimize new development that typically leads to an increase in the flow of wastewater.\nRebecca Sanin has spent her career fighting inequity in underserved communities and is deeply concerned with the intersection between climate justice and social and economic inequality. She believes education is fundamental in addressing climate change and should be utilized such as in the case of teaching people how to transition to and maintain modern IA septic systems that reduce pollutants in waterways. She also is concerned with poor housing being a social determinant of public health and intends to implement more affordable housing and building opportunities.\nIf elected, Sanin intends to prioritize environmental design to promote safety in her community, such as changing traffic flow to reduce congestion or implementing more sidewalks to promote walkability. She also supports the federal Build Back Better agenda and believes that economic development depends on good jobs, fair pay, and community benefits. She further intends to incentivize Town fleets to reduce emissions and introduce more electric vehicles into her community.\nEugene Cook is a small business owner and has been a Councilman for the past 10 years in the Town of Huntington. As Councilman, he has fought overdevelopment in his municipality and takes issue with the drastic increase in housing costs that make homeownership much more difficult than in past decades. He greatly values communication with his constituents when making decisions for the Town, and especially prioritizes listening to the needs of small business owners, particularly during COVID times, as a small business owner himself.\nIf elected, Cook intends to mandate all homes with over 50% reconstruction to install new IA septic systems and implement grants to have them installed throughout the Town. He also hopes to convert Town buildings to natural gas to increase renewable energy usage and convert the Town\u2019s fleet to all-electric vehicles.\nThank you to our partners and panelists: Adrienne Esposito from Citizens Campaign for the Environment, Eric Alexander from Vision Long Island, and Mariah Dignan from Climate Jobs NY.

Throughout the cold war, the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, the first manned moon landing. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.\n\nThe 2000s saw a major shift in the center of political and economic power in the", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 7, "avg_token_entropy": 0.12201810990275115, "avg_token_perplexity": 1.2898509015519455, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

In my case, my husband\u2019s job occasionally requires him to leave for months on end. Instead of letting the loneliness take over my sense of adventure, I have learned to embrace it. Through my experiences I have found that there are a few things you should do before going to ensure the safety and happiness of everyone. Let\u2019s dive in to these 5 tips for hiking solo with kids.\nBefore you hit any trails, you want to be sure your children are comfortable with hiking. It would not be a wise decision to take them on their very first hike without anyone there to help. Hiking with kids is not always easy and it can take some extra effort to convince smaller kids to trek through certain spots.\nTake plenty of time to build up your kids endurance and skills with the help of a friend or family member before you take to the trails alone. If any part of hiking makes your child uncomfortable, you should not attempt hiking alone with them.\nIt is always essential to research the terrain before you head out on a hike. This is especially true when hiking solo with kids. You want to make sure you pick a trail that is well within your child\u2019s skill level. Things to be mindful of are how long the trail is, elevation gain, and how popular the trail is.\nThe younger the kid, the shorter the distance you should aim to cover (unless you are comfortable with baby wearing). You don\u2019t want to run the risk of them being too tired to complete the trail. Personally, I tend to stick to trails that we have completed before as a family so I know they can handle it.\nIt\u2019s also important to make sure there aren\u2019t any significant inclines on the trail you choose. Steep uphill treks could be too much for those little legs to handle. Finally, for more of a safety reason, I stick with trails that are popular and frequented by fellow hikers. This is more of a peace of mind thing. In case someone gets hurt, you will easily be able to ask for help.\nIf you read my post on tips for hiking with kids, you know that I take preparedness very seriously. As I mentioned before, hiking with kids is not always easy if you aren\u2019t properly prepared.\nThe main thing to keep in mind is that your kids are kids. They are going to want to want to explore in leaves, chase butterflies, and maybe even play some games along the way. When planning your route and estimated time to complete, take into account the side adventures you will be on so you know you won\u2019t get stuck in the woods after dark.\nYou also need to prepare for what you will wear and bring for the journey. The most important things to pack are tons of water and snacks. If you have a toddler or smaller child you plan on wearing, I highly recommend getting a hiking backpack like this one by Kelty. These packs are full of extra storage so your hands can stay free. If your child will be walking, make sure they are wearing proper hiking footwear like this option from KEEN. Having proper footwear is not only important to ensure safety, but also their comfort along the way (two very common themes in this post if you haven\u2019t already noticed).\nWhen venturing out into the wilderness alone (whether you are going with or without kids), it is important to let someone know your plans. Be sure to tell trusted friend or family member which trail you are going to, what car you are driving, and how long you plan on the hike taking. In the event something happens, you want to be sure someone knows you are out and when to expect you home.\nFor extra safety, there is an iPhone app called the Bugle app which allows you to file an itinerary of your hike. If you do not check back in at your estimated time, a notification will be sent to your emergency contact along with instructions on how you would like them to handle the situation. You can also carry a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) which will immediately send your exact location and an emergency alert to the proper authorities. For ideas on where to find a PLB, start here.\n9 times out of 10, when you cross paths with other hikers they are nature enthusiasts like yourself who are just as excited to be outside. In the event you run into the 1 not well meaning person (or animal) it is important to have some form of protection. I know for a lot of people, the first thought that pops into their head when they hear the word protection is a gun. The truth is there are many other options out there so its up to you to choose which one you feel most comfortable with.\nI choose to carry around a pepper spray like this and I always keep it in an easy accessible pocket. Another form of protection I love to bring along is my dog. She is the sweetest thing, but she\u2019s also very protective of our family so I know we are safe if we ever encounter a person or animal that intends to inflict harm.\nHave Fun Hiking Solo With Kids!\nThat wraps up my 5 tips for hiking solo with kids.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8\u00a0million square miles (9.8\u00a0million km2), the United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area. With around 326\u00a0million people, the United States is the third most populous country. The capital is Washington, D.C. and the most populous city is New York City.\nThe indigenous peoples of the U.S. mainland, including their descendants, are known as Native Americans, or American Indians. (In Canada, they are known as First Nations.) Native Americans are often subcategorized by their language group or region (i.e., Alaskan Native, East Coast Native, Plains Indian, Southeast Indian, Arctic Natives, and Northwest Coast Native). The first people to settle in the land between the Pacific and the Atlantic, later known as the U.S., were Native Americans. It is estimated that 75\u00a0million people lived in the area between 250 and 1\u00a0bce. The Native American culture is typically based on self-sufficiency of their communities through their customs, traditions, and their laws, and they have a deep respect for nature. There are over 700 federally recognized tribes. Most of them are Native Americans but up to 28 are Native Hawaiians or Alaska Natives. These peoples are largely recognized, and many have their own governing bodies in their territories. The Great Plains tribes consisted of buffalo hunters following the great herds. Because the bison were their primary resource, they tended to be nomadic. In the Northwest, the Pacific Salmon fishery was a primary resource; consequently, people lived in permanent villages made of wooden longhouses. Tribes in California and the surrounding areas had more diverse economies that were centered on hunting and gathering, but also included fishing and limited agriculture. The culture of Native Americans is preserved and practiced by members of indigenous tribes and is generally shared and taught through oral traditions.

At , the United States is the third or fourth largest country by total area, and the third largest by land area and by population, with about 325 million people. The nation's capital is Washington, DC, and its largest city is New York City. It is a federal republic and a representative democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. The country is traditionally described as a classically \"plurilateral\" nation, one with many ethnic, religious, and cultural origins.\nHistory.\nNative Americans have been living in what is now the US since many thousands of years ago. The first Europeans, led by Spanish explorer, Juan Ponce de Leon, arrived in 1513. They called the land Santa Mar\u00eda de Borinquen after Saint Mary. However, other Europeans began arriving and building colonies. One of the first of these was Saint Augustine founded in 1565. By 1733, 13 British colonies existed across the eastern coast of the country. There was frequent fighting between the British and the French colonists during the 1600s, 1700s, and 1800s. One example is the Seven Years War. There was also some fighting in the northern and middle colonies between the Americans and the American Indians.\nIn 1775, the American Revolutionary War broke out and the American colonies declared independence from Great Britain in the Declaration of Independence. In 1776, the American Continental Congress appointed a committee to design a Seal for the new United States. The committee, headed by Benjamin Franklin, and including John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, suggested a design with Moses leading the Israelites into the Promised Land. It showed 12 tribes of Israel marching in the form of a hexagram, one of the symbols of King Solomon, signifying the six-pointed star. It also showed the date MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776) written on a scroll.\nAfter the Americans won the Revolutionary War, they formed a confederation of states under the Articles of Confederation. After only a few years, the Articles of Confederation were replaced by the United States Constitution, which was signed September 17, 1787.

Since 2010, we have introduced over 100 new measures to tackle avoidance and evasion, securing and protecting over \u00a3200 billion that would otherwise have gone unpaid. The Government remain committed to continuing their strong track record on clamping down on those who seek to avoid or evade paying their fair share.\nMy Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his response. The OBR is suggesting a 35% fall in GDP. As the Minister said, the Government obviously need as much tax revenue as they can get, but it needs to be fair. In the Times, there are reports of examples from Arcadia, The Range, and Starbucks, which is in line for rate relief alone of \u00a328 million. Virgin Active, which is on a turnover of \u00a3168 million and paid virtually no tax, could gain \u00a316 million in rate relief. There are similar examples of many other companies, but will the Minister confirm that it is wrong for companies making large profits in the UK not to pay their fair share of tax? Will the Government refuse to give such companies rate relief?\nMy Lords, all the support that we have offered has been aimed at keeping businesses going and securing employment, mostly through the furlough scheme. While I take on board the noble Lord\u2019s concerns, I believe that the rapid action that we have taken, which has to be general by the definition of the time period that we have had to operate in, has helped to secure businesses\u2019 long-term future, which is our priority.\nMy Lords, many other countries have set out strict requirements to prevent state support enabling not only tax avoidance but excessive executive pay and high dividend payments. Do the Government support a moratorium on dividend payments and share buybacks for companies that receive state support, and will they introduce specific rules to prevent tax-avoiding companies benefiting from government schemes?\nI assure the noble Lord that all these things are continuously under review. As I mentioned briefly in the previous Question, we have introduced in days things that could often take years, so by definition we are keeping a very careful eye on them. To give the noble Lord some reassurance, with most of these loan schemes, businesses have to show that they are viable, and if they are going to continue to pay dividends the banks will take a view on that and decide whether it is appropriate. These are not automatic entitlements; they have to be justified.\nMy Lords, I declare my interest related to the Bank of England, as set out in the register. The Minister referred to the plethora of regulation and law that came in in the period after 2008-09, but he will recall that the bankers who were bailed out paid themselves excessive bonuses and therefore suffered in the court of public opinion. Will the Government go a little further and at least publish the list of companies that are benefiting from all kinds of taxpayer support on offer this time, so that we can see who is benefiting from it in a transparent manner? Where the Government give support to those companies, will they at least require an equity holding as collateral and preferably give only loans, not grants?\nThe noble Baroness makes very good points, and I will certainly take her ideas back to the Treasury. We also ought to acknowledge that a number of senior managers have announced pay cuts during this difficult time. Our overall macro concern at the moment is to protect businesses and employment and to make sure that we can bounce back as quickly as possible from this crisis, but I take on board her helpful comments.\nThe noble Lord, Lord Leigh of Hurley, does not appear to be there.

At this point in time it is hard to identify which they are, but we can see that it is happening with some traders and private equity players, and it may well be happening in the digital industry, which is becoming more and more dominant and, as others have said, pays almost no tax in the UK despite the size of its presence. Following our exit from lockdown and the pandemic, will the Government look at a windfall tax so that those who have sacrificed during the pandemic understand that the burden is being spread over everyone\u2019s shoulders?\nThe noble Baroness makes a sound point. It is just too early to make those sorts of assessments. I want to pick up on the point about digital companies. We have introduced the digital services tax, which came into play on 1 April this year; it is a 2% tax on the revenues which search engines and social media platforms derive if they generate more than \u00a32 billion over the next five years. We have made a start on this but, as the noble Baroness will probably know, these things need international collaboration. If there are excessive profits over the next few months, we will of course review things.\nI am sure the Minister is aware that 80% of the population believes that registering a company abroad in a tax haven to avoid paying full UK tax is wrong. At a time of unprecedented social solidarity, would it not help to cement that solidarity if the Government made it clear that they will offer bailouts only to companies that do not follow this practice? After all, France, Poland and Denmark have done that. It would be sad if we stayed a long way behind those countries. If I may, I will send the Minister a list of five criteria drawn up by the fair tax alliance to help the Government to make fair decisions in this area.\nI take on board the noble and right reverend Lord\u2019s points, and I would be interested to see the five criteria that he mentioned. I reiterate that the thrust of our approach has been to support businesses that are active in this country with premises and people. In a way, our approach is quite similar to that of Poland, because we require that foreign businesses have a permanent establishment here. I reassure the noble and right reverend Lord that we have taken a huge amount of action over the past 10 years to clamp down on poor tax practice.\nI support the Government\u2019s broad, sector-wide approach to helping to preserve jobs as an emergency measure, but the companies based offshore that have avoided paying taxes in the UK have in many cases made windfall profits from those at home in isolation. Echoing the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, should we not look at ways of introducing windfall taxes so that these companies contribute fairly to the taxpayer\u2019s support for other firms that have suffered Covid-related losses as a consequence?\nI think that most of us share the noble Baroness\u2019s views on abusive tax measures by companies. Apart from all the measures that we have introduced over the past seven or eight years, we announced that we will legislate this year in a Finance Bill for 2021 to strengthen HMRC\u2019s existing anti-avoidance powers to make it more difficult for promoters, in this case, to sidestep their obligations. We will continue to bear down wherever we can.\nOne measure highlighted by the Minister was the new tax evasion offence for corporations and partnerships that do not act properly in their operations. Will the Minister consider expanding that offence to include enterprises that aggressively pursue individuals\u2014mainly those who are potentially vulnerable or re-entering the workforce, such as NHS workers. Tax evasion is an act that morally subverts the law, especially for self-employed people who will have to pay extra tax at the end of this crisis.\nI am sure that the noble Lord will contribute to the legislation when it comes through. I support his ideas. I assure noble Lords that we have closed the tax gap quite dramatically over the past 10 years. In 2005-06, it was \u00a34.9 billion; in 2017-18, it was \u00a31.8 billion.

At the end of the 19th and start of the 20th centuries, African Americans who had been enslaves were mostly freed after the Civil War, but lived as legal second-class citizens in a system of segregation known as \u201cJim Crow\u201d. The economy was driven primarily by industrialization in the Northeast and farming and mining in the South. Mass European immigration, with especially large numbers of new, culturally and ethnically diverse immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, continued throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Hawaiian Islands, overthrown at the start of the 20th century, joined the union as a U.S. territory and state in 1959. In 1930 the Great Depression began, and at the start of the Second World War, the United States emerged as a global superpower.

Let that sink in for a moment. That\u2019s right, sit back, sip that brew and let that number settle \u2014 $1 billion. Now think about how many microbreweries we have in the province, or better yet, consider that Calgary, a city of 1.1 million thirsty souls, has only three microbreweries (plus some brewpubs). With those numbers alone, it\u2019s probably safe to say that we need more local brews.\nWhile the market share of microbreweries in our province hasn\u2019t been pinned down by an august organization like Statistics Canada, it hovers around three per cent, according to those who work at the breweries, leaving an astonishingly large market share to lure. In the States \u2014 far ahead of Canada in terms of embracing microbreweries and innovative beers \u2014 some markets report a craft brew take of 10 to 40 per cent. Calgary needs more beer. And those that are already brewing? They say bring it on.\n\u201cCompetition, I suppose, is one word for it, but overall I think a better beer scene with more brewers benefits everybody involved at this level,\u201d says Brian Smith, the operations manager at Wildrose Brewery.\nIn other words, one of three craft breweries in Calgary is struggling just to meet demand, and it\u2019s not even the big guy on the block.\nOut in the sprawling, wide-lane expanse that is the Foothills Industrial Park, the green metal roofs of Big Rock\u2019s complex offer a respite from gravel, dust and car parts. Surprisingly, Bob Sartor, the president and CEO who faced the impossible task of taking over from the larger-than-life Ed McNally, agrees with Smith on the need for more faces in the local beer scene.\nOkay, so everyone plays nice. But what does that have to do with the need for more small breweries in the city? It doesn\u2019t matter if a bunch of beer lovers get together to talk over the mash tun, what matters is the effect it has on the city, in a general sense and in an economic sense, right?\nAt a recent webinar presented by Calgary Economic Development and appropriately hosted at Village Brewery, Scott Metzger, an economist and the owner of Freetail Brewing Company in San Antonio, broke it down. Although his numbers related to the U.S. market, they\u2019re just as applicable here.\nThat may seem like a bad argument to make, particularly to a crowd at a Calgary Economic Development event, but let\u2019s hear him out.\nAccording to Metzger\u2019s numbers, a large multinational like Anheuser-Busch employs approximately 116,000 people worldwide in its massive operations.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is located in the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The United States also possesses five populated and numerous unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km2) and with over 320 million people, the United States is the third-largest country by total area and the third-largest by both land area and population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland at least 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence, which established the United States of America. The ensuing war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787; its ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government. The Bill of Rights, comprising ten constitutional amendments, was ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. In the 1800s, the United States acquired land from France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Russia, and annexed the Republic of Texas and the Republic of Hawaii. Disputes between the agrarian South and industrial North over states' rights and the expansion of the institution of slavery provoked the American Civil War of the 1860s.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories and various possessions. At 3.8\u00a0million square miles (9.8\u00a0million km2) and with around 315 million people, the country is the fourth largest by total area and third largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries.\nThe nation was founded by thirteen colonies of Great Britain located along the Atlantic seaboard. On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed their independence from Great Britain and their formation of a cooperative union. The rebellious states defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence. The Philadelphia Convention adopted the current United States Constitution on September 17, 1787; its ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government. The Bill of Rights, consisting of ten constitutional amendments, was ratified in 1791.\nIn the 19th century, the United States acquired land from France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Russia, and annexed the Republic of Texas and the Republic of Hawaii. Disputes between the agricultural South and industrial North over states' rights and the expansion of the institution of slavery provoked the American Civil War of the 1860s. The North's victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the end of legal slavery in the United States. By the 1870s, the national economy was the world's largest. The Spanish\u2013American War and World War\u00a0I confirmed the country's status as a military power. In 1945, the United States emerged from World War\u00a0II as the first country with nuclear weapons, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and a founding member of NATO. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.\nThe United States is a federal republic and a representative democracy. It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), NATO, and other international organizations.

The Spanish\u2013American War and World War\u00a0I confirmed the country's status as a military power. In 1945, the United States emerged from World War\u00a0II as the first country with nuclear weapons, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and a founding member of NATO. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.\nThe United States is a federal republic and a representative democracy. It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), NATO, and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal and real GDP, the highest average wage, and the highest national income per capita in the world, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP.

Under the right conditions, these systems offer a variety of advantages to homeowners, but those advantages should be carefully weighed against the drawbacks to determine whether or not these systems are a good option for your home.\nAn example of particular concern is any situation where a homeowner is considering replacement of a boiler with mini-split heat pumps, while expecting the same heating performance that they\u2019ve enjoyed with their existing system.\nMini-split systems have, in part, gained popularity because they\u2019re able to provide heat and air conditioning to a space and are easy to install in a small area, such as an addition or a sunroom. In addition, these systems are ductless, meaning they don\u2019t require a network of ductwork behind walls, under floors, or in ceilings in order for them to operate. They hang on the upper part of walls or in the ceiling and only require power connections and refrigerant lines, which are fed between wall joists and connect to an outside condenser. They can be an effective way to add air conditioning to a home which is heated by a boiler and does not have ductwork. The challenge comes when these systems are asked to provide heating as well. In warmer parts of the country, these systems can adequately satisfy the heating load for most of the year. In times of the year that more serious cold sets in, or in areas of the country that experience a \u201ctraditional winter\u201d, the limitations of these systems become evident.\nIn heating mode, these mini-split heat pumps, which run entirely on electric power, extract heat from outdoor air, and through a refrigerant cycle, deliver that heat to indoor spaces.\nAs such, the unit\u2019s ability to efficiently provide heat to the home is greatly dependent on outdoor air temperature. Unlike a boiler, which maintains the same efficiency level regardless of outdoor conditions, the efficiency of a heat pump in heating mode falls dramatically as the outdoor temperature drops.\nMany mini-split manufacturers claim the ability to provide heat to a home down to 0\u00b0F or lower outdoor ambient temperatures. While this may be true, there comes a point where the unit is not operating much more efficiently than an electric baseboard system might. This can result in surprisingly-high electric bills. A ductless heat pump in North Carolina, for example, is likely to provide heat much more efficiently than one in upstate New York, New England, the Great Lake states, etc.\nThe question to consider here is: How cold do my winters get, and how long is the heating season in my area?\nAlso, a properly installed boiler, which is not affected by outdoor temperatures, will maintain setpoint temperatures dependably. There are instances where mini-split heat pumps are not able to maintain setpoint. Part of this is due to how it works, but a significant part is evident in what it is actually designed to do. For that, we have to talk about basic physics; hot air rises and cold air falls. Being mounted either at the top of a wall or in the ceiling, a mini-split will do a great job at cooling, as the AC function will cascade cooling air down into a room. Conversely, by pumping warm air through the same system in an attempt to heat a living space, a mini-split is attempting to defy physics. Yes, you will feel warmth in the upper part of the room, but your ankles and feet won\u2019t be enjoying the same experience. As a sidenote, homes with ductwork and furnace/air conditioning systems also make this tradeoff. In areas that experience cold winters, the ducts port air into floor vents. Heat rises! These systems are actually designed with winter in mind.\nA good question to ask yourself: Do I prefer to keep my home very warm in the winter with a smooth and even distribution of heat, or am I willing to accept the possibility that I may need to sacrifice some level of indoor comfort if I replace my boiler with a mini-split system?\nBoiler systems are known to be the longest-lasting type of heating system available. Mini-split heat pumps do not have the same reputation. When used for both heating and cooling, they generally have a shorter lifecycle. A large factor is that these units will likely be running in both heating and cooling modes for most of the year.\nBeyond that, every component in a mini-split heat pump system is proprietary, manufactured by a single company and specifically intended for that system only. Like most electrical devices, these systems are rendered obsolete in a few short years.\nBecause of this, these systems can\u2019t typically be partially replaced, repaired, or upgraded. Rather, the entire system needs to be replaced at considerable expense.\nBoiler systems, on the other hand, are forward-backward compatible, mostly without proprietary components. The boiler, pump, pipe, controls and valves are all independent components that can be repaired, replaced or upgraded at any time.\nAsk yourself: Am I willing to accept that mini-split heat pumps don\u2019t last as long as boilers, and that repair or partial replacement options may be few or non-existent in the event of a failure?\nConventional boiler systems have a distinct advantage over ductless heat pumps in that there are no outdoor components to the system.

Condensers are prone to icing over while in heating mode, depending on outdoor conditions. Because of this, they often require an electric base pan heater. When this electric element is installed, it draws a good deal of power to keep the condenser coil free of ice.\nTo compound the issue of winter ice accumulation, mini-split condensers must be mounted high enough to remain clear of the anticipated snow load. If they are not, the homeowner must remember to shovel snow away from the unit to ensure proper air circulation.\nAsk yourself: Am I willing to keep the condensing unit clear of debris and snow?\nThe majority of boiler installations in North America serve as the source of hot water in addition to space heat.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area. Its population of over 328.2 million people makes it the third most populous country in the world. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city by population is New York City.\n\nPaleoindians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies following the French and Indian War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775, and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of the United States as an independent country by the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories, displacing native tribes, and gradually admitting new states. By the 1870s, the national economy was the world's largest. The Spanish\u2013American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a military power. In 1945, the United States emerged from World War II as the first country with nuclear weapons, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and a founding member of NATO.

The U.S. Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787; ratified by 11 states in 1788; and replaced the Articles of Confederation. The first 10 amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guaranteed many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.[21] During the 19th century, the United States annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845, the Oregon Territory in 1846, California in 1850, and Alaska in 1867. The 1846 Oregon Treaty, a compromise set the U.S.-Canada border along the 49th parallel. The Nonintercourse Act of 1817 asserted U.S. sovereignty over Florida and established a claims process for the remaining Spanish lands. The dispute led to a war in 1812. New territories were acquired following the Mexican-American War of 1846\u20131848, the Gadsden Purchase of 1853, and the subsequent enlargement of the United States to the south and west.

The rice will be US $-200 PMT cheaper than our produced Basmati. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to lose our brand space and let our people die with hunger just for the sake of profitability of these hoarders.\nChaudhry Samee Ullah expressed his deeper concern over the silence of Punjab Government that has failed to crack down on the hoarders despite such higher prices. \u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of the Punjab Government to curb the prices down so that food inflation doesn\u2019t affect our people. This is not possible without a major crackdown on hoarders\u2019 mafia\u201d.

Why are incumbents virtually certain to be reelected? Does campaign money or redistricting doom challengers? What might be done to increase competition in our elections?\nThe 4-minute You Tube video, Texas Legislation, is several years old but still just as true \u2013 and just as shocking \u2013 today.\nSpeakers talk about the impact of negative political advertising on the 2012 election, including the history of negative ads and how those ads affect people's views.\n\nThe United States of America (USA), also known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It is a federal republic comprising fifty states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, as well as various possessions. At 3.79 million square miles and with around 310 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area and population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.\nThe United States of America originated from Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain on the eastern coast of the present day United States. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting the American Revolutionary War, the colonies became independent states and formed a confederation known as the United States. The \"United States\" referred to the confederation of states that emerged at the end of the war and was considered to have started in 1789, with the first meeting of the Congress of the Confederation, or 1781, when the \"United States of America\" was mentioned in its first written Constitution, the Articles of Confederation. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and became part of the Constitution.\nThe United States emerged from thirteen British colonies along the East Coast. In the eighteenth century, it expanded westward across the North American continent, obtaining new territories, sometimes displacing Native American tribes, and gradually admitting new states until the nation spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the nineteenth century, the United States became an industrial power. This continued with the emergence of many modern industries, and by the early twentieth century, the United States had developed into a world power. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the nineteenth century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish\u2013American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower. It was the first country to develop nuclear weapons and is the only country to have used them in warfare.

Its capital is Washington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City, both located at the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The country shares land borders with Canada to its north and Mexico to its south as well as several territorial water boundaries with Canada, Russia and Cuba. The national government is composed of three separate branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislative branch is a bicameral Congress, which consists of the House of Representatives and Senate. The executive branch consists of the President, his Cabinet and other appointees. The judicial branch (or judiciary), composed of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, exercises judicial power.\nThe United States Census Bureau estimates the country's population to be 315,253,000 as of November 2012 and is projected to become an increasingly diverse society.

Provision of non-health support service (20) and provision of technical service (19) were the most common types of PPPs. Eighty-seven percent of contractual arrangements are binding Memorandums of Agreement/Understanding (MOA/MOU). Fifty one percent of partner selection was done thru competitive bidding. Most partnerships have monitoring and evaluation schemes in place, as well as sanctions for non-compliance to contract. Hospitals with partnerships stated that there was a general improvement in efficiency and health care delivery. Project managers suggested that partners should shoulder the risks and benefits of the partnerships equally in order to ensure the sustainability of the program, while the major difficulty encountered was overcoming the existing bureaucracy in the government.\nThis study shows that PPPs have been widely used by hospitals for a variety of purposes. To be effective, partnerships should have time-bound, measurable effects on the health of the community. Corporate social responsibility programs and outright donations should not be considered as PPPs, as they have little measurable impact on the health of the intended recipients.

Eighty four PPPs past and present were documented. Majority of the hospitals go into PPPs to provide for services that are unavailable (25), and improve efficiency (18). Provision of non-health support service (20) and provision of technical service (19) were the most common types of PPPs. Eighty-seven percent of contractual arrangements are binding Memorandums of Agreement/Understanding (MOA/MOU). Fifty one percent of partner selection was done thru competitive bidding. Most partnerships have monitoring and evaluation schemes in place, as well as sanctions for non-compliance to contract. Hospitals with partnerships stated that there was a general improvement in efficiency and health care delivery. Project managers suggested that partners should shoulder the risks and benefits of the partnerships equally in order to ensure the sustainability of the program, while the major difficulty encountered was overcoming the existing bureaucracy in the government.\nThis study shows that PPPs have been widely used by hospitals for a variety of purposes. To be effective, partnerships should have time-bound, measurable effects on the health of the community. Corporate social responsibility programs and outright donations should not be considered as PPPs, as they have little measurable impact on the health of the intended recipients. Effective partnerships share several features, including clear structure, adequate staffing, sufficient core resources, and transparent decision-making processes. Partnerships should look at experiences with PPPs on health globally, as there have been numerous accounts of successful partnerships in improving the health status of their stakeholders.\n\nThe United States of America (USA), also known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third largest country by total area. With a population of over 324 million, the United States is the third most populous country. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The U.S. economy is the largest national economy in the world, with a nominal 2014 GDP of $17.419 trillion. The U.S. economy also ranks first in the world in total aggregate household wealth owned by individuals, with over $58.5 trillion in 2014.\n\nThe nation was founded by 13 colonies of Great Britain located along the Atlantic seaboard. On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed their independence from Great Britain and their formation of a cooperative union. The rebellious states defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence. Recognizing the emergence of an independent Union, Great Britain negotiated peace, which was achieved in 1783 with the Treaty of Paris. In the late 1780s, the national government was formaled by the Constitutional Convention under the United States Constitution. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guaranteed many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.\n\nDriven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century.

Many people believe the United States has the best entertainment industry, with it's movies, music, and sports.\n\nThe United States was originally inhabited by various Indian nations before explorers from Europe began settling the land and claiming it for their respective governments. In the 1600's, the British claimed the eastern portion of the nation, and by the 1700's, many American's were fed up with the British system of government, and declared independence from their country, in what would later be known as the Declaration of Independence. The American's went to war against the British for their independence, winning it with the aide of French troops, and gaining it in the Treaty of Paris.\n\nIn the 1800's, the United States gained most of the land west of the Mississippi river through an agreement with Mexico, which gained it's independence from Spain, after which, the United States gained the state of California, and much of the modern day Southwest. Around that time, in the 1860's, several Southern states left the union in what was known as the Civil War. The Union, or northern states, won the war in 1863, and slavery was abolished soon after.

Here it seems that internal considerations point away from it. It\u2019s true that John\u2019s writings usually have a direct object with \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c9 (though cf. 1 Jn 3.14b; 4.8, 20), but that could also be a further argument for preferring the shorter reading as the harder one.\nI confess I would find the Byzantine Priority position more consistent if it said that \u201ctransmission considerations\u201d (i.e., external evidence) is decisive and that internal evidence is only needed secondarily for large splits in the Byzantine witnesses. At that point, we would still have to discuss the logical objection I mentioned, but that would be a post for another day. As it is, the internal evidence is a key reason why I find any all-or-nothing approach to the Byzatine text (or any other text) unconvincing. As Tommy et al. have put it: \u201cno single manuscript, manuscript family, or larger group of manuscripts (a text type) can be accepted uncritically as representing the original version of a biblical passage or book...\u201d (Dictionary of the Bible and Ancient Media, p. 414).\nYes, Byzantine manuscripts are very good overall. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re always right.\nA canonical text doesn't have to be \"always right\" it has to be \"more than reasonably reliable.\" And it has to be closed, fixed, final and received by the church as such. A never finished scolars' text seeking what is \"always right\" can never be received by the church, because no one knows what it will read in the next edition.\nBut it is in fact received by the church around the world.\nWouldn't the argument be that some scribes dropped the pronoun by accident and other scribes supplied a referent for the pronoun on purpose? I don't see why the behavior of one scribe must, in the name of consistency, dictate what a completely different must do, particularly when it is alleged that one variant is accidental. An I missing something about the consistency argument here?\nGood point, Stephen. Maybe my problem is that readings 2 and 3 both explain reading 1 equally well, so how do we decide which one led to reading 1? I guess by asking which of those two best explains the other. But it still seems more economical to say that reading 1 led to both reading 2 and 3.\nOK, economy is a different argument than consistency, and one that seems more appealing (at least to me) as an explanation.\nPeter, your opening statement is not fully accurate: \"The most noteworthy feature of the Byzantine priority position to me is not that it seriously values the Byzantine text (I think that\u2019s generally good); it\u2019s that it always prefers a Byzantine text.\" Hodges and Farstad did not do this: 15 minority readings in the PA and 150 in the Apocalypse were published as the text in their edition of the MT. Of course, Pickering said that his mentor Zane had given the theory a black eye, and the RP text has, so far as I can tell, only majority readings (is that right, Maurice?).\nWhen Hodges taught the course on NT textual criticism in the late 70s at Dallas Seminary, I recall him saying that his genealogical work would prove (he thought) that the Byzantine text was always right. To his credit, he allowed his method to overturn his presupposition 165 times.\nDan: \"the RP text has, so far as I can tell, only majority readings (is that right, Maurice?).\"\nOnly where Byz/Gothic \"M\" is undivided (but this also holds for the Hodges-Farstad edition).\nWhere Byz itself is heavily divided, the RP edition, like H-F in many instances (e.g. 1Cor 13.3), follows a reading with somewhat lesser but still substantial numerical support (not always the case with H-F due to their stemmatic approach). Of course, most such occurrences in both H-F and RP occur in the Apocalypse, but in RP the H-F type of stemmatics is absent.\nI should also note that in the PA most significant variant readings necessarily are \"minority\", given that the primary transmissional lines there (von Soden's \u03bc5, \u03bc6, \u03bc7) often divide so as to produce only \"non-majority\" variants within that pericope.\nPeter Gurry: \"I find it incredible that the text found in any one manuscript or subset of manuscripts is always right.\"\nAn important part of BP theory is the idea that large elements of the minuscule tradition, the K^X group in particular, cannot easily be collapsed into a \"subset\" such that they all are basically one voice. Of course no one MS or set of very closely related MSS contain the true text in every particular.\nExactly, this true for any form of Textual Criticism that relies on external evidence as the primary method for determining the original text, not Just Byzantine Priority.\nI agree with Stephen C. regarding the issue of consistency; rejecting one reading for a particular reason (haplography, harmonization, you name it) doesn't obligate one to reject all other readings that can be explained the same way. Such decisions depend on (1) the probabilities you assign to different types of transcriptional changes (e.g., based on scribal habits) and (2) how external evidence plays into your evaluation of the variant (if it does at all). The only approach I can think of that could possibly demand such strict internal consistency would be thoroughgoing eclecticism, and I don't even think that it does so in practice.\nByzantine priority, to the contrary, places a premium on external consistency; MAR's emphasis on \"transmissional considerations\" and his article on \"Rule 9\" illustrate this point. As Stephen B. has already described, its general strategy is to decide intrinsic probabilities based on manuscript support and to use intrinsic and transcriptional evidence only to break ties in the external evidence or confirm the chosen reading. The effect of this, as you point out, is that the Byzantine prioritist's decision process sometimes appears to ignore transcriptional probabilities whenever they don\u2019t favor the Byzantine text.\nThe severity of this perceived problem really depends on (1) the disparity between transcriptional probability in each direction and (2) coherence in transmission. Given a Byzantine reading and a non-Byzantine reading, let\u2019s say there\u2019s a probability p that the Byzantine reading gave rise to the non-Byzantine reading, and a probability q of change in the opposite direction. Generally, the non-Byzantine reading will have coherent support in a small group of witnesses, so we conclude that if it was a scribal innovation, it only arose on one occasion, giving a total probability of p. As Stephen B. has pointed out, Byzantine priority rejects the notion that the Byzantine tradition can be treated as a single later witness, so Byzantine prioritists would argue that the common reading, if it was secondary, could not have coherent support. In other words, for some number k > 1, the common reading must have arisen k times independently. If indeed these k transcriptional events were independent, then the total probability of the Byzantine reading arising as it did would be q^k. So even if, at face value, the non-Byzantine reading better explains the Byzantine reading (i.e., if q > p), it will often be the case that once coherence is taken into consideration, the Byzantine reading will be transcriptionally more likely (i.e., p > q^k). Thus, in practice, Byzantine prioritists only need to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the Byzantine reading could give rise to the other reading; as long as the probability p isn\u2019t too small, it will do. The most important questions we might ask in this scenario are (1) what the actual values of k really are, and (2) whether or not all k transcriptional events were indeed independent. The CBGM seems capable of answering both questions; classical stemmatics could do even better, provided contamination is accounted for.\nOn a related note, I\u2019d be interested to know the coherence for each of readings 1\u20133 in 1 John 4:19. From a Byzantine-priority standpoint, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to imagine reading 2 giving rise to the relatively popular reading 3 and the singular reading 4 (both by way of expansion), and reading 3 subsequently giving rise to reading 1 (by homoiotelueton).\nIt's encouraging to me that we can so easily discuss the possibility of a Byz reading being the right one. That has certainly changed in the quarter-century that I have been involved in TC. And as Stephen pointed out, it's not a certain family of mss that we look to for the correct reading, but the whole picture. HOW did it turn out that most mss have auton, unless it was in the text to begin with? But Peter, can you decode that cryptic last section of the ECM apparatus for those of us not on the cutting edge?\nThe last section? Do you mean after the fourth reading?\nThat's versional evidence.

It\u2019s true that John\u2019s writings usually have a direct object with \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c9 (though cf. 1 Jn 3.14b; 4.8, 20), but that could also be a further argument for preferring the shorter reading as the harder one.\nI confess I would find the Byzantine Priority position more consistent if it said that \u201ctransmission considerations\u201d (i.e., external evidence) is decisive and that internal evidence is only needed secondarily for large splits in the Byzantine witnesses. At that point, we would still have to discuss the logical objection I mentioned, but that would be a post for another day. As it is, the internal evidence is a key reason why I find any all-or-nothing approach to the Byzatine text (or any other text) unconvincing. As Tommy et al. have put it: \u201cno single manuscript, manuscript family, or larger group of manuscripts (a text type) can be accepted uncritically as representing the original version of a biblical passage or book...\u201d (Dictionary of the Bible and Ancient Media, p. 414).\nYes, Byzantine manuscripts are very good overall. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re always right.\nA canonical text doesn't have to be \"always right\" it has to be \"more than reasonably reliable.\" And it has to be closed, fixed, final and received by the church as such. A never finished scolars' text seeking what is \"always right\" can never be received by the church, because no one knows what it will read in the next edition.\nBut it is in fact received by the church around the world.\nWouldn't the argument be that some scribes dropped the pronoun by accident and other scribes supplied a referent for the pronoun on purpose? I don't see why the behavior of one scribe must, in the name of consistency, dictate what a completely different must do, particularly when it is alleged that one variant is accidental. An I missing something about the consistency argument here?\nGood point, Stephen. Maybe my problem is that readings 2 and 3 both explain reading 1 equally well, so how do we decide which one led to reading 1? I guess by asking which of those two best explains the other. But it still seems more economical to say that reading 1 led to both reading 2 and 3.\nOK, economy is a different argument than consistency, and one that seems more appealing (at least to me) as an explanation.\nPeter, your opening statement is not fully accurate: \"The most noteworthy feature of the Byzantine priority position to me is not that it seriously values the Byzantine text (I think that\u2019s generally good); it\u2019s that it always prefers a Byzantine text.\" Hodges and Farstad did not do this: 15 minority readings in the PA and 150 in the Apocalypse were published as the text in their edition of the MT. Of course, Pickering said that his mentor Zane had given the theory a black eye, and the RP text has, so far as I can tell, only majority readings (is that right, Maurice?).\nWhen Hodges taught the course on NT textual criticism in the late 70s at Dallas Seminary, I recall him saying that his genealogical work would prove (he thought) that the Byzantine text was always right. To his credit, he allowed his method to overturn his presupposition 165 times.\nDan: \"the RP text has, so far as I can tell, only majority readings (is that right, Maurice?).\"\nOnly where Byz/Gothic \"M\" is undivided (but this also holds for the Hodges-Farstad edition).\nWhere Byz itself is heavily divided, the RP edition, like H-F in many instances (e.g. 1Cor 13.3), follows a reading with somewhat lesser but still substantial numerical support (not always the case with H-F due to their stemmatic approach). Of course, most such occurrences in both H-F and RP occur in the Apocalypse, but in RP the H-F type of stemmatics is absent.\nI should also note that in the PA most significant variant readings necessarily are \"minority\", given that the primary transmissional lines there (von Soden's \u03bc5, \u03bc6, \u03bc7) often divide so as to produce only \"non-majority\" variants within that pericope.\nPeter Gurry: \"I find it incredible that the text found in any one manuscript or subset of manuscripts is always right.\"\nAn important part of BP theory is the idea that large elements of the minuscule tradition, the K^X group in particular, cannot easily be collapsed into a \"subset\" such that they all are basically one voice. Of course no one MS or set of very closely related MSS contain the true text in every particular.\nExactly, this true for any form of Textual Criticism that relies on external evidence as the primary method for determining the original text, not Just Byzantine Priority.\nI agree with Stephen C. regarding the issue of consistency; rejecting one reading for a particular reason (haplography, harmonization, you name it) doesn't obligate one to reject all other readings that can be explained the same way. Such decisions depend on (1) the probabilities you assign to different types of transcriptional changes (e.g., based on scribal habits) and (2) how external evidence plays into your evaluation of the variant (if it does at all). The only approach I can think of that could possibly demand such strict internal consistency would be thoroughgoing eclecticism, and I don't even think that it does so in practice.\nByzantine priority, to the contrary, places a premium on external consistency; MAR's emphasis on \"transmissional considerations\" and his article on \"Rule 9\" illustrate this point. As Stephen B. has already described, its general strategy is to decide intrinsic probabilities based on manuscript support and to use intrinsic and transcriptional evidence only to break ties in the external evidence or confirm the chosen reading. The effect of this, as you point out, is that the Byzantine prioritist's decision process sometimes appears to ignore transcriptional probabilities whenever they don\u2019t favor the Byzantine text.\nThe severity of this perceived problem really depends on (1) the disparity between transcriptional probability in each direction and (2) coherence in transmission. Given a Byzantine reading and a non-Byzantine reading, let\u2019s say there\u2019s a probability p that the Byzantine reading gave rise to the non-Byzantine reading, and a probability q of change in the opposite direction. Generally, the non-Byzantine reading will have coherent support in a small group of witnesses, so we conclude that if it was a scribal innovation, it only arose on one occasion, giving a total probability of p. As Stephen B. has pointed out, Byzantine priority rejects the notion that the Byzantine tradition can be treated as a single later witness, so Byzantine prioritists would argue that the common reading, if it was secondary, could not have coherent support. In other words, for some number k > 1, the common reading must have arisen k times independently. If indeed these k transcriptional events were independent, then the total probability of the Byzantine reading arising as it did would be q^k. So even if, at face value, the non-Byzantine reading better explains the Byzantine reading (i.e., if q > p), it will often be the case that once coherence is taken into consideration, the Byzantine reading will be transcriptionally more likely (i.e., p > q^k). Thus, in practice, Byzantine prioritists only need to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the Byzantine reading could give rise to the other reading; as long as the probability p isn\u2019t too small, it will do. The most important questions we might ask in this scenario are (1) what the actual values of k really are, and (2) whether or not all k transcriptional events were indeed independent. The CBGM seems capable of answering both questions; classical stemmatics could do even better, provided contamination is accounted for.\nOn a related note, I\u2019d be interested to know the coherence for each of readings 1\u20133 in 1 John 4:19. From a Byzantine-priority standpoint, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to imagine reading 2 giving rise to the relatively popular reading 3 and the singular reading 4 (both by way of expansion), and reading 3 subsequently giving rise to reading 1 (by homoiotelueton).\nIt's encouraging to me that we can so easily discuss the possibility of a Byz reading being the right one. That has certainly changed in the quarter-century that I have been involved in TC. And as Stephen pointed out, it's not a certain family of mss that we look to for the correct reading, but the whole picture. HOW did it turn out that most mss have auton, unless it was in the text to begin with? But Peter, can you decode that cryptic last section of the ECM apparatus for those of us not on the cutting edge?\nThe last section? Do you mean after the fourth reading?\nThat's versional evidence. L = Latin, K = Coptic, G = Georgian I think, Sl = Slavonic. The sigla after the letters represent specific translations or manuscripts of those versions.\nOkay, thanks. So I get Latin: Vulgate and Koptik: Sahidik. Syriak: Phyloxenian and Koptik: Boharik (what is V_v_?). And A angstorm is Armenian?\n\nThe United States of America (USA), also known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America.

It", "full_output": "Are you wondering what are chia seeds good for? Chia seeds have earned the reputation of being a super-food due to the many benefits they offer. They offer a high level of nutrition, support a healthy lifestyle, and aid in weight loss.\nChia seeds are seeds of a desert pant called salvia hispanica, which is a member of the mint family, Lamiaceae, native to Mexico and Guatemala. It appears humans have began using chia seeds from as early as 3500 B.C., with the Aztecs and Mayans consuming them as staple foods.\nChia seeds were given to Aztec warriors as survival food, with one tablespoon believed to sustain an individual for 24 hours.\nChia seeds were used as medicine to revive skin, cure joint pain and stimulate saliva by the Aztecs.\nThe name \u201cchia\u201d derived from a Mayan word for \u201cstrength\u201d.\nChia seeds were even used to pay tributes and taxes to Aztec priests and nobility.\nChia seeds were banned after the Spanish conquest due to its association with the Aztec religion.\nChia seeds have quite a bit of fiber, delivering 11 grams of fiber per 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) of chia seeds.\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends that you get 25 grams of fiber a day if you are a woman and 38 grams of fiber a day if you are a man.\nBy taking 2 tablespoons of chia seeds twice a day (which is super easy), if you are a woman you will meet 88% of your daily recommended fiber intake!\nChia seeds have a surprisingly high amount of omega-3 fatty acids, even more than flax seeds. They actually contain omega-6 fatty acids as well. The ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in chia seeds is 3:1, which is helpful since most people consume way too much omega-6 compared to omega-3.\n2 tablespoons (1 ounce) of chia seeds have 4,915 mg (4.9 g ) of omega-3 fatty acids and 1,620 mg (1.6 g) of omega-6 fatty acids .\nOne thing to note about the omega-3 fatty acids in chia seeds is that they are mainly ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), and not EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) or DHA (docosahexaenoic acid).\nTo be beneficial, ALA needs to be converted to EPA and DHA in our body, which are the omega-3 fatty acids that are considered important for our health.\nAlthough we can convert ALA to EPA and DHA, the conversion rate depends on the person, and on average, is not very high. According to Dr. Fuhrman of the Eat to Live diet, on average, for women, up to 21% is converted to EPA and about 9% is converted to DHA. For men, less than 8% is converted to EPA and less than 4% is converted to DHA.\nRecommended daily EPA and DHA dose (combined) is at least 500 mg for healthy people and 800 mg to 1,000 mg for people with heart problems .\nSince chia seeds have an abundance of ALA, you will probably be able to get your required amount of EPA and DHA just from chia seeds.\nHowever since conversion rates differ depending on the individual, some people may need to supplement their EPA and DHA from other sources such as fish oils.\nThere are 177 mg of calcium in 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) of chia seeds, which is 18% of the daily recommended value. Taking chia seeds is an easy way to supplement your calcium especially if you are on a vegan diet or do not eat dairy products.\nChia seeds are rich in antioxidants, so much so that their whole seeds do not deteriorate easily and have a very long shelf life.\nAntioxidants are essential in preventing harmful chemical reactions that are caused by oxidation. Oxidation takes place as part of converting food into energy, but it can also create free radicals that can ultimately damage or kill healthy cells.\nRegularly consuming chia seeds rich in antioxidants will help prevent damage due to free radicals, helping to promote general health and prevent many age-related diseases.\nThe wonderful thing about chia seeds is that they absorb liquid up to 12 times their own weight. So when you consume chia seeds, they will expand in your stomach, and help you stay full longer and prevent overeating.\nHere is a video by Dr. Oz explaining the benefits of chia seeds for weight loss.\nConsidering their weight loss and nutritional benefits, chia seeds are relatively low in calories. 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) of chia seeds have 137 calories. Chia seeds are a great snack to have for weight loss and general health.\nUnlike flaxseeds, you do not need to grind them to reap their nutritional benefits; you can enjoy them whole.\nContains 4 grams of protein per 2 tablespoons (1 ounce).\nAccording to WebMD, people also use chia seeds for high blood pressure and diabetes, and for reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\nCan be put in almost anything from a flavor perspective, since the taste is relatively neutral.\nHere are some simple and weight loss friendly ways to start consuming chia seeds right away. Recommended dose is 1-2 tablespoons, 1-2 times a day.\nSimply put in a glass of water and drink right away.\nPut 1.5 tablespoons of chia seeds in 3/4 cup of water and leave for 30 minutes, allowing it to form a gel. Mix in \u00bc cup of coconut milk or almond milk. Sprinkle in some stevia and mix.\nPut in plain unsweetened yogurt and let sit for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Sprinkle in some stevia and mix.\nPut in freshly squeezed juice and drink right away, or let stand for 20 minutes.\nTip: If you leave chia seeds in liquid, they will expand and form a gel/pudding. This is a great way to enjoy chia seeds as a snack/dessert.\nThis is a trenchant, fantastic compilation of information on chia seeds!

The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the east coast. Disputes with Great Britain about post-Revolutionary War trade led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European power. The current United States Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.\nDriven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved the acquisition of land from France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Russia, and the displacement of American Indian tribes, with the Louisiana Purchase, Texan Revolution, Oregon Treaty, Mexican\u2013American War, and Alaska Purchase expanding U.S. territory. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country in 1865. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.

Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783). On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The country's Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787, and ratified by the states in 1788. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.\nDriven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country.

All Our Happy Days Are Stupid, a home-grown play by Sheila Heti, is no exception. Famously considered \u201cunstageable\u201d for many years, it\u2019s been taken on by Jordan Tannahill, a local artist whose star is rapidly rising. The result is a quirky show with cartoonish comedy, a piecemeal plot with absurd undertones, and charming (if scattered) meditations on the nature of happiness.\nJenny Oddi (Lorna Wright) and her parents are on vacation in Paris watching a parade when they spot Daniel Sing (Nicholas Hune-Brown), a school friend, and his parents. Both mothers are decidedly unpleasant: Ms. Oddi (Naomi Skwarna) is chronically bored and condescending, while Mrs. Sing (Becky Johnson) is judgmental and strident. The women have an argument and the Oddis leave with Jenny, while Daniel is swept up in the parade and disappears.\nJenny thinks that she is very smart and wants her mother to stop dismissing her and her peers for being only twelve years old. Mr. Oddi (Alexander Carson) is gruff and wants everyone to stick to the vacation schedule he has planned. There does, however, seem to be real attraction between husband and wife. Mr. Sing (Jon McCurley), by contrast, is simperingly clingy with his wife, who barely notices him. In fact, while continuing to have conflict with Ms. Oddi, she begins fantasizing about becoming close friends with her.\nA man in a panda suit (Michael McManus) starts talking about threesomes in front of Jenny, leading to a hilarious fight between him and Mr. Oddi. Then the hotelier (Anne Wessels) of the place where both families are staying at asks Ms. Oddi, an amateur flutist, to play before their esteemed guest \u201cThe Prince For All Seasons\u201d (Carl Wilson), and his young bride (Meghan Swaby). What the Prince really wants, though, is to steal the services of a special maid (Erin Brubacher, who directed the show along with Tannahill). And after that I\u2019ll just say that high-jinks ensue.\nThe characterizations are stylized for the effect of broad comedy, almost to the point of clown in some cases. Similarly, the set and all the props are two dimensional and drawn in black on flat white surfaces, which the actors adeptly keep facing the audience. Their costumes are likewise all black, white and grey: there is no colour in All Our Happy Days Are Stupid.\nA singer with a guitar (Henri Faberge), appears during scene changes and plays songs that elaborate on the mood, or the message, or the action at that point. In one scene he appears as a character, rock star Johnny Rockets; this is one of the best sections of the play, as the young stud is given some advice by an old man (Kayla Lorette) in the form of a story that is both funny and touching.\nMost of the play cannot be described as \u201ctouching.\u201d It\u2019s not an emotional experience, but it is one full of laughter and is also mildly intellectual. By that I mean that afterward my companion and I were engaged in figuring out what all the difference scenes and characters had to do with the theme of happiness/fulfillment. It was similar to the pleasure of putting mental effort into a jigsaw puzzle and succeeding in figuring out how all the pieces fit. I also found that in the process of analyzing the disparate pieces of the play to see how they held together, I discovered some nuance in what is otherwise an unsubtle show.\nAll Our Happy Days Are Stupid is much like a precocious twelve year old itself: it takes its own weirdness a bit too seriously, but it\u2019s still adorable.\n", "prompt": "World Stage is known for producing non-traditional theatre that eschews conventions of plot and characterization.

The women have an argument and the Oddis leave with Jenny, while Daniel is swept up in the parade and disappears.\nJenny thinks that she is very smart and wants her mother to stop dismissing her and her peers for being only twelve years old. Mr. Oddi (Alexander Carson) is gruff and wants everyone to stick to the vacation schedule he has planned. There does, however, seem to be real attraction between husband and wife. Mr. Sing (Jon McCurley), by contrast, is simperingly clingy with his wife, who barely notices him. In fact, while continuing to have conflict with Ms. Oddi, she begins fantasizing about becoming close friends with her.\nA man in a panda suit (Michael McManus) starts talking about threesomes in front of Jenny, leading to a hilarious fight between him and Mr. Oddi.

What the Prince really wants, though, is to steal the services of a special maid (Erin Brubacher, who directed the show along with Tannahill).

You will find this will give better performance when you know the regular expression is going to remain constant.\nThe second option above creates a RegExp object using a constructor function. This option compiles the regular expression in runtime. This means that if you know the regular expression will change or you do not know the pattern, due to user input, this is the preferred method for RegExp object creation.\nThere are three basic modifiers, or flags, for RegExp, they are i, g, m. The i modifier is used when you want to perform a case-insensitive search. Case-insensitive means search all words and ignoring the capitalization of letters. The g modifier is used when searching \u201cglobally\u201d in your code. This means it continues to search for a match after the first match is made and returns all matches in your code. The g modifier will only search for the expression you enter and is case sensitive. If you enter the expression var patt1=/or/g;, it will return matches containing \u201cor\u201d. For example, the word \u201cor\u201d would be chosen and the word \u201cselector\u201d would be chosen, as it contains the pattern \u201cor\u201d. You can also combine the modifiers to perform a global, case-insensitive search by using gi.\nThe m flag, or modifier, is called the multiline flag.

At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2) and with over 320 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area and the third most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland at least 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the East Coast. Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of the United States as an independent nation. The original political structure of the U.S. was a confederation in 1777, ratified in 1781 as the Articles of Confederation. After long debate, this was supplanted by the Constitution in 1789, forming a more centralized federal government. In 1791, an accompanying Bill of Rights was ratified to guarantee inalienable rights, such as freedom of speech and the right to keep and bear arms.

A foreign national can come here, kill someone, be arrested, convicted and put in prison, then be released and deported.\nThen they can reenter the country illegally.\nIn recent days, much of the nation and the media have been fixated on a homicide case being tried in Wisconsin. But how much attention was ever focused on the 23 homicides carried out in this country by the foreign nationals who, after their convictions, imprisonments and deportations, had allegedly returned illegally to Arizona?\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas runs the federal agency that is responsible for securing our borders and enforcing the immigration laws. This week, he testified in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nWhat was he concerned about?\nThe first section of the written testimony he submitted to the committee was headlined \"Terrorism.\" This is a threat, he told the committee, that has \"evolved.\"\n\"In the years immediately following 9/11, the primary threat evolved from foreign terrorists to homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) -- the individuals in America who are radicalized by a foreign terrorist organization's ideology,\" he said. \"The threat has evolved further and now includes domestic violent extremists (DVEs) -- U.S.-based lone actors and small groups who seek to further political or social goals wholly or in part through unlawful acts of force or violence, without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group or foreign power. These actors are motivated by various factors, including biases against minorities, perceived government overreach, conspiracy theories promoting violence, and false narratives often spread online.\n\"Today,\" Mayorkas continued, \"U.S.-based lone actors and small groups who are inspired by a broad range of ideologies, including HVEs and DVEs, pose the most significant and persistent threat to the homeland.\"\nThe government official responsible for securing our border, in other words, sees the \"most significant and persistent threat\" to our country coming from other Americans. He does not see it coming from foreign nationals who were convicted of homicide in the United States, deported and then illegally reentered the country.\nTo deliberately harm someone's property or person is an evil act for which the perpetrator must be held legally accountable. An American citizen who does so as a political protest should face the legal consequences just as surely as an alien who does so for other reasons.\nWill Mayorkas stop foreign nationals who have already been convicted of homicide in this country from illegally crossing our border?\nNeither he, nor any future Homeland Security secretary, can ever hope to do so if there is no physical barrier at our border and people can continue to cross illegally without ever being screened by Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe United States of America (USA), also known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.80 million square miles (9.8 million km\u00b2) and with around 320 million people, the country is the world's fourth-largest by total area and the third-most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries.

Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to what is now the United States mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the East Coast. Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787; its ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government.

This tutorial explains the basic usage of the Python console and the editor and gives several examples on the automatization of CityEngine tasks.\nMore information on the CityEngine-specific Python command set can be found in the CityEngine help by clicking Help > Help Contents > Python Scripting Reference.\nThe Python scripting interface is not available in all CityEngine versions.\nImport the Tutorial_10_Python_Scripting project into your CityEngine workspace.\nOpen the Tutorial_10_Python_Scripting/scenes/01_PythonScripting.cej scene.\nOpen the console window by clicking Window > Show Console.\nOpen a Python console using the small triangle on the right side of the toolbar.\nYour first CityEngine Python command is a fast way to select scene elements with a specific name.\nPress Ctrl+Space to show the command completion pop-up.\nType the ce.setSelection(ce.getObjectsFrom(ce.scene, ce.withName(\"*Broadway*\"))) command.\nThis selects all scene elements with names that contain the word \"Broadway.\"\nAs soon as you plan to use longer and more advanced Python commands, or a set of commands, it's helpful to use the Python editor in CityEngine.\nTo create a new Python script, click File > New > Python Module.\nThe Python module dialog box appears.\nIn the Python module dialog box, browse to the scripts folder of your project.\nType myHelpers as the name for your new Python module.\nSelect the Module:Main template.\nThe new Python module myHelpers opens in the Python editor in CityEngine.\nAdd the new selectByAttribute(attr, value) function after the line ce = CE().\nCall it with specific parameters in the main clause of the script. Make sure the main block is at the end of the file.\nTo execute the script, click Python > Run Script in the menu, or press F9 while in the Python editor.\nIn the Python console, add the path to your module to the system path.\nCreate a new file scripting.py in your CityEngine workspace using the file browser of your operating system.\nYou can add arbitrary code to the scripting.py file. The startup module is executed automatically during CityEngine startup when a new Python console is opened and a script is run from the Python editor.\nMake sure your scripting.py file is valid and executes correctly; otherwise, Python code in CityEngine cannot be executed. Open a Python console in CityEngine after you create or modify a scripting.py file; problems with executing the scripting file are displayed there.\nscripting.py is read only once on CityEngine startup. If you modify the file, make sure to restart CityEngine.\nIf the script is not correctly updated on CityEngine startup, delete the Python cache directory $USER_DIR/.cityengine/$CEVERSION_DIR/pythonCache/.\nOften, you may want to increment the street width attribute of many segments. If this cannot be accomplished easily in the GUI, a Python script can help.\nCreate a new rule file by clicking File > New > Python > Python Module.\nChoose the project's script folder, name it setStreetWidths, and choose the Module: Main template.\nThis function increments the streetWidths attribute of all the selected street segments with a value specified by the user.\nYou need to get all selected segments and loop over them.\nTo calculate the new street width, get the current value first using the ce.getAttribute() command. Note the syntax of the attribute name with the prefix /ce/street/; this accesses the user attributes of the object.\nFinally, calculate the new street width by adding the user-provided parameter increment and assigning the new value to the segment.\nThe entire function.\nIn the main block of the script, add the function call, and choose an increment.\nSelect a set of street segments.\nRun the Python script (Menu Python > Run Script), or pressF9 while in the Python editor.\nExecuting the previous script may take some time. This is because script execution in CityEngine runs in a separate thread and updates the GUI and the 3D viewport after every command. In this case, after every setAttribute() call, the street network is updated, and the 3D viewport is redrawn.\nWhile this is convenient for this example, normal execution needs to be faster. This can be achieved by adding the @noUIupdate marker above the function definition.\nFunctions marked this way will block GUI update during execution but, depending on what they do, will execute faster by factors.\nSome combination of scripting commands with the @noUIupdate marker may freeze the user interface.\nIf you encounter a UI freeze or other unexpected behavior when using @noUIupdate, modify your scripts so that @noUIupdate only marks a small, specific function rather than marking your whole script.\nThis function sets several attributes at the same time, namely, streetWidth, sidewalkWidthLeft, and sidewalkWidthRight.

The 48 contiguous states and Washington D.C., the capital district, lie in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is situated in the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2) and with over 320 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area and the third-largest by both land area and population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies following the French and Indian War led to the American Revolutionary War, which began in 1775, and the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.

The first 10 amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.\nThe United States went on to acquire land from France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Russia, and annexed the Republic of Texas and the Republic of Hawaii. Disputes between the agrarian South and industrial North over states\u2019 rights and the expansion of the institution of slavery provoked the American Civil War of the 1860s. The North\u2019s victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the end of legal slavery in the United States. By the 1870s, the national wealth was the world\u2019s largest. The Spanish\u2013American War and World War I confirmed the country\u2019s status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

But, more importantly, you run the risk of losing your commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) and, with it, the ability to earn a living. A first offense commercial DWI will cost you your CDL for a year, while a second conviction will cost you your commercial license permanently.\nA commercial DWI lawyer in Grand Prairie can help protect your legal rights and fight for your commercial driving privileges. Contact the Law Offices of Randall B. Isenberg today at 214-696-9253 to schedule a free consultation.\nWhat Constitutes a Commercial DWI?\nIn Grand Prairie, commercial drunk driving charges relate to the type of driver\u2019s license you hold, rather than the type of vehicle you drove at the time of your arrest.\nIn other words, if you have a Texas CDL, you will face commercial drunk driving charges, whether you were driving a passenger vehicle or a commercial vehicle while intoxicated.\nThe statutes that govern individual drunk driving laws are contained in Chapter 49 of the Texas Penal Code. The additional laws that address commercial DWI come from the Texas Transportation Code (TTC).\nEssentially, commercial DWI charges apply if a CDL holder violates either of these statutes. This means either driving a personal vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08 or above or driving a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04 or above.\nYou also violate the commercial drunk driving statutes if you drive under the influence of drugs (legal, illegal, or controlled substances).\nWhat Penalties Are Different for a Commercial DWI?\nUpon conviction for a commercial DWI, you will face fines and penalties that far exceed those applicable to non-commercial drunk driving charges. The specific charges and penalties that apply depend on what type of vehicle you drove while drunk, your prior criminal record (if applicable), and any aggravating circumstances.\nA CDL holder who drives drunk in a personal vehicle will face the typical Class B misdemeanor charges for a first DWI offense. Conviction on a Class B misdemeanor carries a $2,000 fine and as much as six months behind bars.\nHowever, if you had a BAC of 0.15 or above, you will face Class A misdemeanor charges, with a $4,000 fine and up to one year in jail \u2014 even for a first offense.\nThe judge is also likely to require you to perform community service, attend substance abuse counseling, and install ignition interlocks on all your vehicles.\nThe big difference between a commercial DWI and a regular DWI is that a commercial DWI conviction also carries CDL disqualification penalties.\nHow Will Commercial DWI Disqualification Penalties Affect You?\nThe statutes refer to suspension of a CDL as a disqualification because conviction of a commercial DWI disqualifies the license holder from driving a commercial vehicle.\nA first offense carries a one-year disqualification period. However, if you transported hazardous materials while intoxicated, you face a three-year disqualification period.\nUpon conviction for a second commercial DWI, the statutes dictate a permanent disqualification penalty.\nYou also face permanent disqualification if you refuse to submit to BAC testing after your first commercial drunk driving conviction.\nWhat Are the BAC Testing Laws for Commercial DWI?\nFor non-CDL holders, the police must have reasonable suspicion of a violation of the law before making a traffic stop. Officers must then establish probable cause before making an arrest or requesting that the driver undergo BAC testing.\nFor CDL holders, the laws that dictate when police can request BAC testing are significantly stricter for drivers.\nPer regulations enforced by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, law enforcement officers can conduct BAC testing if they suspect in any way that the driver could be intoxicated. Police can also test a CDL holder after any type of accident or simply at random.\nYou can refuse BAC testing; however, you will face a one-year disqualification the first time you refuse, and a three-year disqualification for any subsequent refusal. You will face a lifetime disqualification if you refuse with 2 commercial DWIs on your record.\nIt is important to note that these regulations apply to CDL holders at all times, even when you drive a personal vehicle.\nHow Can a Commercial DWI Lawyer Help You?\nThe penalties for a commercial drunk driving conviction are especially harsh but the biggest challenge for CDL holders pertains to their future ability to earn a living.\nAlthough you only face a one-year disqualification for your first offense, your conviction will become part of your permanent criminal record. Consequently, unless you are an independent owner-operator, you may have trouble finding a company that will hire you to drive commercially with a DWI on your record.\nMounting an aggressive defense against drunk driving charges can help protect your livelihood. A commercial DWI lawyer in Grand Prairie can protect your legal rights and help you fight for your future.\nWe will begin by evaluating the prosecutor\u2019s evidence related to your arrest and BAC testing, in search of any potential errors or violations of your legal rights. Using any such transgression, we can negotiate with the prosecutor to reduce or drop the charges, or even petition the court to dismiss your case.\nFailing an acceptable reduction or dismissal of the charges, we can build a case for your defense at trial.\nIf you already lost your CDL due to a DWI conviction, you can seek the assistance of a criminal defense lawyer to potentially help you get your CDL reinstated.\nBefore you make any decisions or attempt to fight drunk driving charges on your own, talk through your case with a commercial DWI lawyer.\nAttorney Randall Isenberg will put his 30+ years of experience to work on your case. He will work tirelessly on your behalf, to build a strong defense and help you achieve the best possible outcome in your case.\nCall us today at 214-696-9253 to schedule your no-cost, no-obligation consultation and case review with a commercial DWI lawyer in Grand Prairie.", "prompt": "If you face commercial DWI charges, you face the possibility of stiff fines and jail time.

The 48 contiguous states and the federal district of Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwest corner of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2) and with over 320 million people, the country is the world's fourth-largest by total area and the third most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife.

The country's wildlife is also diverse, including the \"American Bison\", which has been an important animal in American history and still roams the Great Plains; also, native species such as the \"Monarch Butterfly\" can be found throughout the country.\nThe United States was founded by thirteen colonies of Great Britain located along the Atlantic seaboard; they declared independence on July 4, 1776, ratified the constitution on June 21, 1778, and defeated the Kingdom of Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence. The original \"thirteen\" states were followed by the north-west expansion to Oregon, Texas in the early 19th century, the midwestern states, the California Gold Rush from 1849 and the purchase of Alaska in 1867, and the annexation of Hawaii. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the United States became a global power after its involvement in World War I and World War II and the Cold War. Its growing cultural influence has made the United States a prominent leader in modern popular culture.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), the United States is the world\u2019s third or fourth-largest country by total area, and the third-largest by both land area and combined area. It is one of the world\u2019s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies following the French and Indian War led to the American Revolutionary War, which began in 1775, and the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787; ratified by the states in 1788; and went into effect on March 4, 1789. After the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments of the Constitution, was ratified in 1791, the United States began a policy of expansion across North America. The U.S. purchased the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803, extending the country\u2019s territory to the Pacific Ocean. The country was divided by the Civil War in the 1860s. The North\u2019s victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the end of slavery in the United States. The Spanish\u2013American War and World War I confirmed the country\u2019s status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the 1969 Moon landing.

They are found in Dairy, Juice, Wine & Water bottling plants throughout Africa.\nOzone systems are specifically designed for bottle rinsing and package disinfection.\nDisinfects bottles in less than 5 seconds.\n(Adjustable from 0.00 to 2.00 ppm).\nRecycling of rinse water (reduces consumption from +/- 1000 litres/hour to +/- 500 litres/day.\nBottles cannot be rinsed if ozone level is not correct.\nThe Bright Blue can be supplied with our water-recycling skid, which captures and re-uses the rinse water. This can reduce water consumption from +/- 1000 litres per hour to around 500 litres per day.\nThe Bright Blue bottle rinsing and bottle disinfection system has been constantly improved and refined since the first unit was produced in 2001. The Bright Blue CCS complies with EU/ CE standards and conforms to the Coca-Cola Electrical & Mechanical Standards Specifications.\nOur focus has always been on quality and reliability, so much so that many of our customers regard our systems as amongst the most reliable in their plant.\nIf maintenance and servicing procedures are observed then operational life of around 20 years can be expected.\nThe bottle disinfection system is extremely easy to operate and features software developed by Wassertec. Only occasional interventions are required to calibrate the system against an ozone test kit to ensure correct ozone readings are displayed.\nThe system is controlled by a full colour touchscreen Control Panel. Our unique interface features easy to read dials and icons. Operation is straightforward and intuitive with varying access levels for Operators, Administrators & Technicians.\nOn a day-to-day basis the operator simply pushes the start/stop button. The Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) does the rest.\nFor systems making use of the built-in Interlocks, this can be done from the Rinser/Filler control panel.\nThe bottle disinfection system features a diagnostic mode which allows the administrator to easily interrogate each of the system\u2019s main components. It allows any of the major components to be run independently so that they can be verified.\nMeasurement & control of Ozone ppm (parts per million) in the water is done using a Dr. Reiss GMBH ozone probe and dedicated PID controller.\nThis allows for accurate control of the desired dissolved ozone level to within as little as 1% of the set-point.\nThe systems can be run in either Local or Remote modes.\nWe use 10\u2033 full colour touch screens, which have optional Ethernet Connectivity.\nWith the system connected to a network it becomes possible to operate the Ozone Generator by remote control from a Desktop or Laptop PC with full access to all functionality.\nWe run with the ozone cells under vacuum. This way if there is an ozone leak, air leaks into the ozone cell as opposed to ozone leaking out. This is inherently safer than running under pressure.\nThe top of our ozone/water contacting systems feature a special ozone resistant de-gas valve. This allows un-dissolved ozone to be vented safely away from the production area whilst maintaining tank pressure.\nUnder normal operation there should be no ambient ozone in the production area.\nDesigned with health and safety in mind. Our systems include built-in safeguards to ensure that operator\u2019s lives are not put at risk and meet Coca-Cola Specifications (Electrical and Mechanical) for safety.\nOur systems have a built-in interface for 2 Draeger ozone leak sensors.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km2) and with over 308 million people, it is the third or fourth largest country by total area and the third largest by both land area and population. It is one of the world\u2019s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the U.S. is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783, leading to independence. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories, displacing Native Americans, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States. Subsequent industrialization, urbanization, and immigration enlarged the country\u2019s economy, dominated the world economy for the first half of the 20th century, and spurred a great migration from farms and small towns to cities. The U.S. Army emerged as the most powerful military in the world during World War I. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower. The U.S. economy is the world\u2019s largest national economy, with an estimated 2011 GDP of $15.1 trillion (22% of nominal global GDP and over 19% of global GDP at purchasing-power parity).

That\u2019s a great concern. My HelloFresh review is that this service simply isn\u2019t the ideal one for me, despite the fact that I can see why some people love it. To start, I should tell you a bit about me. I\u2019m a home cook with limited time to go to the supermarket, living in a studio apartment with an even smaller cooking area, and I make dinner almost every night.\nIn truth, making brand-new dishes weekly (a minimum of one!) is a top priority for me as the Handling Editor of Wide Open Eats \u2013 . After all, if I\u2019m not attempting new things in the house, especially after a long work day, then how will I understand what to really advise? So that\u2019s our set-up in the house.\nWhen you log onto HelloFresh, you pick the meals you wish to utilize in advance. The options aren\u2019t endless, and in truth, there are simply enough to make you seem like you have an option without being overwhelmed. I chose three dinners with different kinds of meat to cover all my bases.\nThe very first box I selected was Tex-Mex Tilapia. Not imagined: Tilapia.

The packaged, fresh ingredients (revealed above) were simple to read and the meal package directions were simple.\nThis HelloFresh meal made method more couscous than I prepared for, and overall my evaluation for this particular HelloFresh meal was that I was pleased with the meal choice I made from the other meal choices. The portion sizes were large, however not too much. I might clear my plate easily, which is unusual, but my boyfriend was grabbing a treat just an hour later on.\nRegrettably, we simply couldn\u2019t wait while we were making dinner, and so the Arugula Salad isn\u2019t visualized since we ate it in about six minutes over the range as the hamburgers prepared. By this 2nd home-cooked meal, I was practically prepared to come around to HelloFresh and turn over to the dark side of meal membership services.\nThe Pineapple Salsa, like the Tomato Onion Jam, was an advanced dish than I envision the majority of us work up when we make pork chops or hamburgers, so it was great to make something beyond my comfort zone with that recipe. This was, by far, my sweetheart\u2019s preferred meal.\nNo, he was shoveling it in his mouth and loving every second of it. Applauding the healthier meals we had consumed that week, he needed to know why my HelloFresh evaluation wasn\u2019t that passionate.

With the pre-packaged components especially, I felt restricted to remain on track. Of course, this part of my HelloFresh review would not always be a problem for others.\nWhile this is great for not eating way too much, there were no leftovers at all. Among the methods we attempt to save money throughout the week is to take leftovers for lunch. While that means I\u2019m making a much larger dinner routinely, it likewise means that those lunches will keep us complete at work for at least two days after.\nI was likewise in the kitchen much longer whipping up those lunches whereas, on a common night, dinner cleanup and lunch-packing happens at when. For our, this just didn\u2019t fit. In hindsight, we might have switched from the traditional box for 2 people to the family strategy box, however I still believe I \u2018d be buying lunches.\nI would make each of these dishes once again, however the problem is that I simply wasn\u2019t excited by them.

So, this year, as a Christmas present from my MIL, we chose to attempt HelloFresh.\nThe Great- The meals were less complicated and a little faster to make than the equivalent meal subscription I had in 2015. Also, the cost had to do with the very same. The recipes won\u2019t blow you away, but they are solidly great. These are the factors this isn\u2019t a 1-star evaluation.

The whole experience seemed driven by accounting professionals and some arcane idea of client service \u2013 .\nTHE UGLY- Spoiled food. Over a 4 week time duration we received 3 shipment of the 3-meal plan, so 9 meal packages amount to. In every shipment I needed to discard spoiled rotten vegetables.

My household had a membership to a different supplier last year for several months, and although the food was great, we believed the meals were a little time-intensive to make. So, this year, as a Christmas present from my MIL, we chose to attempt HelloFresh.\nThe Great- The meals were less complicated and a little faster to make than the equivalent meal subscription I had in 2015. Also, the cost had to do with the very same. The recipes won\u2019t blow you away, but they are solidly great. These are the factors this isn\u2019t a 1-star evaluation. The Bad- Relatively, the management of deliveries and meal options on the HelloFresh site was clunkier.\nOnce again, I\u2019m believing comparatively, and for the exact same cost, the other meal service had a couple of better meal options weekly you might include in your choices at no extra expense \u2013 . HelloFresh Customer Support \u2013 I won\u2019t say it was Ugly, however it wasn\u2019t Great. For factors I\u2019ll describe in the next section, I got in touch with Client service after our really first delivery.\nThey make their money on having long-term customers, right? But I\u2019m really sure I got the scripted response of, \u201cWe can provide you a $10 credit for that.\u201d When I stated, \u201cTruthfully, that\u2019s unsatisfactory,\u201d I got the utilized automobile sales treatment while the representative left to talk to their manager and I cooled my heels, and when the rep came back, the credit went up to over $30.\nThe 2nd amount was in fact over and above what I thought was essential, and if they \u2018d just been reasonable right off the bat, I would have been fine receiving a smaller credit but spending less time dealing with the entire thing. The whole experience seemed driven by accounting professionals and some arcane idea of client service \u2013 .\nTHE UGLY- Spoiled food. Over a 4 week time duration we received 3 shipment of the 3-meal plan, so 9 meal packages amount to. In every shipment I needed to discard spoiled rotten vegetables. This was my frustration when I called customer care after getting our first order. Your business name is Hello FRESH!!! I indicate, REALLY??!! I work from home frequently so I was house for each shipment and popped the meals into the refrigerator right away, so I can just blame bad quality control for this problem.\nThe United States of America (USA), also known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and 326 Indian reservations. The country is situated between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, bordering both the North Pacific Ocean and North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe nation shares land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south as well as maritime borders with Russia, Cuba and the Bahamas. In 1492, Christopher Columbus, while searching for a route to India, established landfall in the Americas, a continent that was initially inhabited by indigenous peoples. Following the colonization of the Americas by European nations beginning in the late 15th century, numerous immigrants migrated to the Americas. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast.\nSubsequently, the United States embarked on a series of imperial acquisitions in North America during the nineteenth century, including the purchase of Alaska in 1867 and the annexation of Hawaii in 1898. It gained several possessions in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and acquired most of its current territory by the end of the nineteenth century. The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the nation\u2019s status as a global power. In the wake of World War II, the United States emerged as one of two superpowers, along with the Soviet Union, and it was considered a great power.\n\nIn the decades following World War II, numerous aspects of the economic sphere of the United States have become the dominant forces in the worldwide economy. The nation was the first country to develop nuclear weapons and is the only country to have used them in warfare, as well as the only country to have used them against another country during combat.\n\nDue to its status as a global superpower, the United States has been officially criticized as being a militaristic power. Political scientists such as Hans J. Morgenthau and John Mearsheimer have said that the United States pursues hegemony because it is a capitalist country and has interests worldwide.

It is a federal republic consisting of fifty states and a federal district. The country is situated mostly in central North America, where its forty-eight contiguous states and Washington, D.C., the capital district, lie between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The state of Alaska is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to its east and Russia to the west across the Bering Strait, and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and numerous unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.8\u00a0million square miles (9.8\u00a0million km2) and with over 320 million people, the country is the world\u2019s fourth-largest by total area and the third most populous. It is one of the world\u2019s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish and Portuguese explorers explored the Caribbean and the coastal areas of North America, while Russian traders reached the northwestern coast. England, France, and the Netherlands began to establish colonies in the 17th century. The United States emerged from thirteen British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes with Great Britain over taxation and political representation led to the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), which is the first successful war of independence fought by a European colony against a European power. Among the descendants of the colonists were many immigrants from Europe, especially the British Isles as well as Protestant Germanic groups. The U.S. emerged from thirteen British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes with Great Britain over taxation and political representation led to the American Revolution.
