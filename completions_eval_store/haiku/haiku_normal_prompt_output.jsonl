Her mother and father had no idea of life above the water and neither did Ariel. As she swam with the fishes and the turtles, she often imagined what it must feel like to be above the waves, but she was too afraid to try it. So, one day, her dad took her on a little adventure.\n\nIt was a bright and sunny day and the water was calm and the sea air was light and salty on her face, she enjoyed the beauty of the underwater world. She saw tiny plankton floating by, sea turtles munching on the grass of the ocean floor, colorful fish, and even a sea turtle with the biggest shell she had ever seen!\n\nBut her father was an adventurous sea turtle and he encouraged Ariel to go further out from the shore. She had never been this far out before and she didn\u2019t want to go any further. But she didn\u2019t want to disappoint her father either.\n\n\u201cCome on, daughter, you can do it. You are almost there and I promise if you don\u2019t like it we can go back,\u201d he told her.\n\nSo she took a big breath and swam and swam and swam until finally she saw land. It was beautiful!

Her mother and father had no idea of life above the water and neither did Ariel. As she swam with the fishes and the turtles, she often imagined what it must feel like to be above the waves, but she was too afraid to try it. So, one day, her dad took her on a little adventure.\n\nIt was a bright and sunny day and the water was calm and the sea air was light and salty on her face, she enjoyed the beauty of the underwater world. She saw tiny plankton floating by, sea turtles munching on the grass of the ocean floor, colorful fish, and even a sea turtle with the biggest shell she had ever seen!\n\nBut her father was an adventurous sea turtle and he encouraged Ariel to go further out from the shore. She had never been this far out before and she didn\u2019t want to go any further. But she didn\u2019t want to disappoint her father either.\n\n\u201cCome on, daughter, you can do it. You are almost there and I promise if you don\u2019t like it we can go back,\u201d he told her.\n\nSo she took a big breath and swam and swam and swam until finally she saw land. It was beautiful!

A complex sentence includes both a dependent and independent clause.  Independent clauses can also be referred to as main clauses or principal clauses.  These sentences express a complete thought or stand-alone sentence.  On the other hand, dependent clauses are phrases that begin with a dependent word.  The dependent word determines the nature of the clause itself and whether or not it will fit into a complex sentence.  There are four types of dependent words: relative pronouns, relative adverbs, subordinate conjunctions, and infinitive markers.  Relative pronouns are one of the four types of dependent words, which make up dependent clauses.  Relative pronouns can be used in complex sentences to introduce the idea of 'who', 'whom', 'which', and 'that'.  They help to create a clear description of the idea expressed in the main sentence.  If you know the nature of the word you are looking to insert, then it is easier to pick the correct relative pronoun and create an appropriate complex sentence.

Here's one, so it must be a definition:\n\n\nThat's an interesting definition, but not really a \"definition\". It defines what it's not, and gives an idea of what it is, but it doesn't tell us \"what\". Perhaps a bit more clarification would be in order.\n\nWikipedia tells us that Haiku \"is a form of unrhymed Japanese poetry\" [1]. I disagree with that definition. It might be an attribute of Haiku, but that's not what makes Haiku Haiku. This is the first thing you can notice when you read Haiku - they're short. Not only short, they're short with a strong syllabic structure. Wikipedia goes on: \"a poem of three lines, usually with five syllables in the first line, seven in the second and five again in the third\".\n\nThat's not quite accurate either. The \"7-5\" definition is popular among Westerners, but not among Japanese. If you're familiar with Japanese you know it's rather difficult to say what syllable the words fall in, as syllables in Japanese aren't usually separated from one another. This is also why the Japanese refer to this \"numbering\" as \"on\" [2], which basically means \"sound\". So you could say that the first sound is at five, the second at seven, etc. This would make \"Haiku\" into a series of 5/7/5/7/5 \"sounds\". However, if you read the Wikipedia definition, it mentions \"syllables\". This can cause a lot of grief when writing Haiku. I'm American, so I don't write in Japanese characters. I use \"Latin characters\", also known as the \"Roman Alphabet\" - in English, these are the letters: \"a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p-q-r-s-t-u-v-w-x-y-z\" (I'll just call them \"letters\"). Since Haiku are made of syllables, and syllables are a way to write down words, I can't just start writing words and go 5/7/5/7/5/7/5 (because that's not syllables, it's a series of words).

For example, a poem about butterflies could be shaped like a butterfly. This poem is called a \"concrete\" poem because it is made from the concrete words of the poem.\n\n10. Write an acrostic: An acrostic poem uses the first letters of a word or phrase as the first letters of each line of a poem. The word or phrase can be your name or the name of the season.\n\n11. Write a \u201cI am\u201d poem: In an \u201cI am\u201d poem, each line begins with the word \u201cI am.\u201d The rest of the poem is written in any style. For example, you can write \u201cI am happy, I am excited, I am so full of joy!\u201d Or, you can choose a different topic like \u201cI am thankful, I am forgiving, I am kind.\u201d\n\n12. Write a tongue twister: A tongue twister is a poem that\u2019s fun to say out loud. They\u2019re often silly and can be tricky to say quickly. For example, \u201cPeter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. Did Peter Piper pick a peck of pickled peppers? If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, where\u2019s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?\u201d\n\n13. Write a funny poem: What makes something funny? Funny things are sometimes silly or absurd, or they can be just plain surprising.

Many haikus are about the seasons.\n\nHaiku is an excellent choice for National Poetry Month because it makes you think carefully about word choice and how to convey a message in as few words as possible.\n\nA haiku must follow the traditional 5-7-5 pattern, meaning that the first and third lines each have 5 syllables, and the second line has 7 syllables.\n\nLet's check out a few examples:\n\n  \u2022 Summer sun\n  \u2022 Hot as the fire in my hearth\n  \u2022 I long for winter\n  \u2022 The first line contains 5 syllables, the second has 7, and the third returns to 5 syllables.\n\n  \u2022 Rainy day\n  \u2022 Dripping from trees and leaves\n  \u2022 A symphony\n  \u2022 This example features an image of nature, just like many haikus, but it also creates a sense of sound, rhythm, and harmony.\n\n  \u2022 Soft, fluffy clouds\n  \u2022 They're like cotton in the sky\n  \u2022 Just like the ones\n  \u2022 Here we have a simile, comparing fluffy clouds to cotton in the sky.

The morning sun is hot, but the grass is sizzling with heat, which creates a more powerful, visual image. The last line is a great example of a metaphor because it compares a person's toes to cold.\n\nHaiku is a lot of fun because it requires you to think about what you want to say in as few words as possible.

For example, five syllables on the first line, seven syllables on the second line, and five syllables on the third line.\n\nHere are some examples of the three different types of Haiku:\n\n\nWinter wind blows\nSnowflakes drift from the sky\nShadows darken trees\n\nBy Lillian\n\nSoft, wet grass\nRain falls gently from the sky\nFlowers bloom, birds sing\n\nBy Alex\n\n\nI love this day, spring\nBirds are singing all around\nAnd flowers are here\n\nBy Miki\n\nYou can also use a Haiku to describe things in life, too. For example, here is the Haiku that I wrote for myself.\n\nHaiku about school\n\n\nA place where I learn\nWith friends I love to see\nAnd teachers to help\n\nBy Michael\n\nAnother type of haiku is the senryu. A senryu is like a haiku, but it's about human nature and life. Some examples are:\n\nThe student's homework\nHis mom's loud voice\nHe's off to work\n\n\nAt the fair today\nPeople laughing at silly things\nWe're all having fun\n\nNow, if you want, you can make a haiku or a senryu about a certain topic. I'll show you how. Let's try it with sports!\n\nHow to Write a Sports Haiku\n\nSports haiku is fun! It\u2019s easy to write them, too.\n\nWe\u2019re going to do an activity where we all make haiku that describe different sports or games. Are you ready? Let\u2019s go!\n\nHere\u2019s how we will do it:\n\n1. First, you will get a piece of paper and draw a picture of a certain sport or game. (You can use any color markers or crayons that you want.)\n\n2. Next, you will write a sentence about your picture and then a haiku poem using the sentence as the subject.\n\n3. When you finish your haiku, you will come back to the group and read your haiku out loud.\n\n4.

It also might be difficult to find an image that fits the syllable count of 5-7-5. Instead, if you focus on a single aspect of a larger subject, you can express a lot more. For example, when writing about a waterfall, you could focus on the power of the falling water, the noise it makes, its rainbow, or the beautiful curves of the water at the base of the waterfall. You might choose a single aspect for each of the 3 haiku that you want to write.\nHere are my 3 haiku:\nThe water falls\nWith a thunderous roar that echoes\nThrough the green forest.\nWhen I read this haiku, I immediately visualize a waterfall. The word \u201cthunderous\u201d in the second line reminds me of both the sound of the waterfall and the shape of the falling water.
