This marks a doubling of online abuse since the survey was last carried out in 2015. Often abuse is received from the same person across multiple posts, or takes the form of fake profiles that are set up to mock sportswomen.\nThe findings are another troubling example of the struggles for women in sport. Recent SMS research on behalf of Women in Football found that three quarters of women in the industry believe that men and women have been treated differently by their employers during the pandemic.

However, many are unaware of the potential hidden dangers involved with gas-powered heating. Of greatest concern is the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.\nCommonly caused by faulty or incorrectly maintained gas heaters, carbon monoxide exposure to your family can be extremely harmful. And in some cases, fatal. Any gas heater can leak carbon monoxide (CO), which can potentially result in carbon monoxide poisoning for anyone who is exposed to it.\nNumerous tragic deaths reported in the USA have been linked to carbon monoxide poisoning. Earlier this year, we heard the heartbreaking story of a family of four found deceased in their Ohio home. But it is also important to be aware that cases of carbon monoxide poisoning are not uncommon in Australia.\nFor example, just last month a family of seven from Sydney\u2019s Eastern Suburbs were rushed to hospital. It was suspected that a pool heating system with a malfunctioning flue had allowed gas to leak into their home. All seven family members displayed signs of carbon monoxide poisoning, including suffering from nausea and dizziness. High levels of carbon monoxide were later identified in their home.\nSimilarly, last winter, four people from the same property in Victoria were taken to hospital suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning. Two of the residents affected were experiencing dizziness and tightness in their chest. It is believed that a gas heater in their home was the source of the carbon monoxide, with firefighters called in to shut off the gas supply and ventilate the property.\nSo, first and foremost, what is carbon monoxide and how can you reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning in your home?\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a gas produced by the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. It is found where fuels such as natural gas, gasoline, oil, propane, wood or coal are burned and the fumes are not properly extracted.\nCarbon Monoxide is colourless, odourless and tasteless. For these reasons, its presence is impossible for the human senses to detect. Fortunately, carbon monoxide alarms are triggered upon the detection of this potentially deadly gas and can be installed to alert householders to its presence.\nHow can I Reduce the Risk of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?\nFirst of all, if you have a gas heating appliance, it is vital that you have it serviced by a licensed and qualified gas fitter every two years. As well as thoroughly inspecting your heating system and checking for correct installation, a professional technician will test for the presence of carbon monoxide in your home.\nIn addition, combined with regular servicing and maintenance of gas appliances, carbon monoxide detectors are a useful device to have in your home. These simple installations can reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning by alerting you to the presence of this harmful gas.\nAlarmingly, a recent study revealed that three-quarters of Australian homes do not currently have a carbon monoxide detector installed; potentially leaving families at risk. If your home falls into this majority, give Service Today a call and ask about having one of our professional technicians install a carbon monoxide detector for you today. Remember: this simple installation can save lives.\nYou should consider having a carbon monoxide detector installed in an area of the house where the alarm will be audible from all the bedrooms. Additionally, you will need to ensure the batteries are regularly charged and the expiry date monitored. It is important to remember that these alarms only detect carbon monoxide; they do not detect smoke, fire or other gases.\nTo arrange for carbon monoxide detector installations, or to book in a service on your gas heater, give Service Today a call on 1300 725 760 or click here to make an easy online booking.

She never remembers a thing she does when she has them but if you tell her about it the next day, she says you must be lying to me cause I don't remember. And, I guess I believe her.

Haikus have a five-syllable line, a seven-syllable line, and a five-syllable line. Sometimes, haikus will have only 10 or 11 syllables, but the three-portion rule is what usually makes the poem count as a haiku.\nHaikus are often about the beauty of nature, but they can be about anything. Like many forms of poetry, haikus often use imagery and other poetic techniques to show rather than tell a story.\nHaikus usually are about nature, and they have a history that spans for thousands of years. First invented in Japan, haikus have influenced many different types of poems from other parts of the world.\nLet\u2019s get to work on your haiku! Here\u2019s a 20-step guide to help you find your inspiration and write a great poem.\nIn this post, we will walk you through a step-by-step haiku guide to help you get to the heart of the poem\u2019s idea. Each haiku poem will contain 17 syllables that are divided into three parts.\nStep 1: Brainstorm Ideas\nGrab your journal and start writing about your most vivid experiences with nature. Whether it\u2019s a walk in the woods or a trip to a nearby park, try to think about a specific memory that stands out. You can think about specific details of the experience to really set the scene.\nWhen you\u2019re done, read the memories you wrote out. Some of them may have more depth than others. Pick a memory that evokes strong emotions or that describes a memory you feel you can describe using strong imagery.\nStep 2: Describe the Image You Have in Your Mind\nGo to your journal, and start writing down all the details you can think of about your memory. Include things like what season it was, who you were with, or where you were in relation to the scene.\nThis poem is about the image you have in your mind. You don\u2019t have to include every detail \u2014 just the ones that you think will really set the scene for the poem.\nStep 3: Begin the Poem\nYou\u2019re ready to begin the poem.

Suffice it to say that countries were approving fossil fuel exploration projects before the ink of the global climate agreement had fully dried. As long as corporations are able to push environmental and social costs off their balance sheets and onto the backs of the weak and defenseless, dirty coal will be burnt and the cheapest slave labor will be employed. Questioning root causes like our inherently unsustainable way of life is still very much taboo and will remain so even after our descendants are sifting through the wreckage. Sure, mainstream publications have expanded their coverage of man-made climate change and global warming, but these existential threats to life on Earth remain an enigma to the vast majority, a footnote in some obscure textbook.\nYes, we are pretty far gone when a four minute comedy routine makes more sense than anything broadcasted on the evening news. Corporate mass media-controlled public debates have degenerated into infomercial sound bites. In a society where success is measured by the key metrics of money and profit, it should be no surprise that a wealthy, xenophobic businessman is able to garner mass appeal by hogging publicity and playing on the fears and base desires of the populus. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is a catchy slogan for a society ignorant of the collapsing world around them and oblivious to the over-consumptive, profligate way of life that is proving to be their undoing. For a celebrity-obsessed culture whose world is falling apart, the next logical choice for its leader would seem to be a reality TV show star who says he can restore the illusion of the American dream and build a great wall to keep all the riff-raff out.\nSo while terrorism takes center stage in the overstretched Empire of Amnesia, remember this simple fact: 303 Americans were killed in terrorist attacks worldwide in the last decade while 320,523 Americans were killed because of gun violence in that same time period. Random mass shootings, capitalism\u2019s \u201cfree market\u201d genocides, the disruption of the Holocene\u2019s stable climate regime by anthropogenic climate disruption, tipping points in the earth\u2019s biosphere, terminal industrial disease, and many other things come to mind that pose a much bigger danger to the average American, but the War on Terror, conceived as open-ended, serves as a conveniently omnipresent boogieman for jerking the chain of the taxpayer and justifying the growth of an intrusive security state. What better way to control the masses as the wheels continue coming off the global economy and the biosphere becomes evermore threadbare. The rich will retreat into their luxury spider holes until the coast is clear.\nPsychological concepts of how we view the world around us, including \u2018creeping normalcy\u2019 or \u2018landscape amnesia\u2019, block day-to-day comprehension of what accelerating human activities represent\u2014whether it is human population, the number of dammed rivers, forest destruction, or the impact of motor car emissions in a timespan that is geologically brief. Creeping normalcy refers to slow trends concealed in noisy fluctuations that people get used to without comment, while landscape amnesia describes forgetting how different the landscape looked 20\u201350 years ago (Diamond 2005: 425).\nAt some point in your life you realize that you\u2019re running out of time, that your health and energy level are slipping, and that your time here on Earth is extremely fragile and transient. You begin to question and re-evaluate what\u2019s important to you. Most still go to their grave with the belief that life will go on for their descendants in a world of never-ending technological \u201cadvancements\u201d and improvements in society. A few reading this blog understand the myth of human progress and that mankind is sleepwalking towards a very dark fate. How could there be any other outcome when we have never really heeded the precautionary principle of environmentalism and, in fact, flagrantly disregarded it? Occasionally a scientist will candidly speak the truth. Recently, Jason Box did just that when he tweeted \u201cwe\u2019re f\u2019d\u201d if just a small fraction of floor carbon is released from the Arctic. Some of us realize what dire straits we are in and all we can really do is watch with a sort of morbid fascination as this dystopian future unfolds before our eyes. A \u201cgrim meathook future\u201d is the inevitable result of a society that worships money, materialism, militarism, and technology.\nFor an articulate and heartfelt expression of the angst of the modern age, I highly recommend reading the blog post Everyone I know is brokenhearted. The author, Josh Ellis, doesn\u2019t mention climate change at all, but he does hit on every other aspect of capitalist industrial civilization and its soul-crushing, alienating culture. Judging from the number of Facebook \u201clikes\u201d, now at 21K and counting, he has really struck a nerve with people. Perhaps it\u2019s fitting and somewhat ironic that Josh has spent much time in the desert megacity of Las Vegas, the ultimate man-made mirage of capitalist decadence.\nAll the genuinely smart, talented, funny people I know seem to be miserable these days. You feel it on Twitter more than Facebook, because Facebook is where you go to do your performance art where you pretend to be a hip, urbane person with the most awesomest friends and the best relationships and the very best lunches ever. Facebook is surface; Twitter is subtext, and judging by what I\u2019ve seen, the subtext is aching sadness.\nI\u2019m not immune to this.  I think a lot about killing myself these days. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to do it and this isn\u2019t a cry for help. But I wake up and think: fuck, more of this? Really? How much more? And is it really worth it?\nThe Blood-Soaked Foreign Policy of the U.S.\nCitizens of the First World live in ignorance of their country\u2019s violent imperialistic history. As Joe Bageant said, \u201cAmericans are cultivated like mushrooms from birth to death, kept in the dark and fed horseshit.\u201d Nonetheless, the average pleb in America should realize by now that they too will be treated no different from those in the Third World exploited by empire. As illustrated by a recent study, U.S. citizens are mere cardboard cutouts in a fa\u00e7ade of democracy with essentially no voice in their government\u2019s actions. The wealthy elite call the shots, determining crucial government policy and the law of the land. When all the propaganda and myths are swept aside, America is revealed to be nothing more than a heartless oligarchy; you and I are simply marketing statistics and consumers, pawns and cogs within capitalist industrial civilization.\n\u2026The improved leverage of US power over Mexico\u2019s economy is not solely an issue of having a workforce so \u2018flexible\u2019 that much of it is forced into sweatshop labour. The maquiladora belt functions effectively as an economic colony, with the local Mexican police, paid for by the Mexican taxpayer, providing the \u2018security\u2019 necessary for factories to operate unhindered by nuisance unions and human rights activists.\nOne of Mexico\u2019s chief exports, then, is labour. Just as profits and goods leave the country, significant amounts of labour time are not reflected in the Mexican economy. Corporations benefit enormously from this win-win situation resulting in the continuing breakdown of society, a state of affairs reminiscent of a colonial economy, albeit without foreign control of what in any case is a pliant government. As a result, Mexican workers in the maquiladoras, notes Delgado-Wise, are little more than \u2018manpower for foreign capital\u2019.\n\u2026With the authorities weakened, the line between the state and the narcotics industry is becoming increasingly blurred. A United Nations report estimated that between 50 and 60 percent of Mexican municipal government offices have been \u2018captured or feudalised\u2019 and coopted by narcotrafficking organisations. Mexican intelligence estimates that 62 percent of the Mexican police are presently under the control of the narco trade. According to rank and effectiveness, members of the police forces can receive anywhere between 5 to 70 thousand pesos monthly from cartels, a dramatic net increase on their state salaries. Of the 2.9 million arms given to the Mexican police forces, 57 percent are used in illicit activities.\n\u2026Historian Miguel Tinker Salas has noted that in the case of Plan Colombia, military spending was intended to crush the strength of rural insurgents and guerrillas to offset the possibility of a popular rebellion, particularly as Colombia had among the worst levels of inequality in Latin America. In Mexico, maintaining a status quo which sees unprecedented levels of inequality and widespread poverty \u2013 exacerbated since the 1980s \u2013 is likely to involve the increasing use of force in order to quash the threat to the established order posed by social movements and popular revolt, all the more real as Mexico inches closer to collapse. Increasing attacks on organisers and activists of the anti-capitalist Zapatista initiative, La otra campa\u00f1a, in Chiapas and the prolonged assault on inhabitants of Oaxaca in 2006 remind us that the state will always use military might to repress challenges to its authority and to the socio-economic order. US training of the Mexican military should be viewed in this light, bearing in mind that imperialism has two arms in Latin America \u2013 one military, the other economic.\nAll the coffee-producing countries of Central America have seen drops in production of 30% or more in each of the past two years. Some, such as Guatemala, report rising cases of chronic malnutrition in coffee workers\u2019 children. Last week Oxfam cited coffee among other crops in a report that warned climate change was putting back the global fight against hunger \u201cby decades\u201d.\nNicaragua\u2019s problem is particularly acute. Along with neighbouring Honduras, and Burma, it is already one of the three countries most affected by climate change, according to the 2013 Global Climate Risk Index. Nearly a third of its working population, about 750,000 people, depend on coffee directly or indirectly for a living. Coffee provides 20% of GDP. The Nicaraguan government is deeply worried: it has predicted that, because of falling rainfall and rising temperatures, by 2050 80% of its current coffee growing areas will no longer be usable.\nWarmer temperatures are also threatening a genetically diverse type of coffee called Arabica which is considered essential to the industry and comprises 70% of global coffee production. According to a recent study, by 2080 global warming will make two-thirds of today\u2019s farms too hot to grow Arabica.\nIn sharp contrast, Nicaragua, an equally poor country that receives far less U.S. aid because of our government\u2019s hostility toward the Sandinistas, sends far fewer children across the U.S. border. Why? Since coming back into power in 2006, the Sandinistas have enacted strong programs designed to allow the poor to become self-sufficient.\nThe only way to actually fix the immigration crisis is to address the root causes I have identified above. The response to date from the U.S. government has been to request billions in detention center and deportation funds, launch a PR campaign in the media of Central American countries to dissuade illegal immigration, and increase spending in law enforcement aid through CARSI (Central America Regional Security Initiative). Meanwhile, right-wing politicians fan the flames of racism and xenophobia with calls for militarizing the border to stop the hoards of swarthy barbarians at America\u2019s doorstep. In reality, the current deteriorating social conditions in Central and South America are a direct result of the American corporatocracy and its rapacious economic system as well as anthropogenic climate disruption. The child migrants flooding across America\u2019s border are, to a great degree, victims of U.S. foreign policy and climate change.\nWhere\u2019s the Evolution?\nInsects, birds, mammals, and fish have all been migrating to cooler zones for the past four decades in response to the cataclysmic climate disruption ignited by industrial civilization, but humans are the only organisms inhabiting this blue orb we call Earth who are not altering their behavior. They live within an energy cocoon that keeps them cool in the summer, warm in the winter, stuffed with massed produced food from mechanized factory farms, and entertained by a virtual world of digital imagery. As cracks and holes in the Earth\u2019s biosphere grow ever larger, the natural response of capitalist carbon man ensconced within his protective energy shell is to try to put a price tag on what is being burned, i.e. fossil fuels, rather than deal with the deeper root cause of an unsustainable economic system and way of life which demands such exorbitant consumption of resources.\nOur energy slaves feed us and control the climate for us while at the same time destroying the natural world that had enabled humans to create such an artificial environment. Detached from nature and enslaved by our own technological creations, we sleepwalk over the cliff of extinction. Our so-called progress will, in the end, disappear like a mirage in the scorching desert sun as nature is sacrificed to the machine of industrial civilization.\nThrowing money into the maw of the \u2018free market\u2019 is the predictable modus operandi of technocapitalism\u2019s indoctrinated disciples who believe such offerings will create a technofix, miraculously healing the planet. In the Star Trek TV series, the Ferengi were an extraterrestrial race whose culture was characterized by \u201ca mercantile obsession with profit and trade, and their constant efforts to swindle unwary customers into unfair deals.\u201d Just like the Ferengi species where profit is the first, last and only important factor, the high temples of private enterprise are commodifying and monetizing the atmosphere just as they have everything else in nature. The colonization of the public mind by capitalism is complete and overriding. We ignore unfolding geologic forces and instead put our faith in manmade market forces to our detriment.\n\u2026The fundamental dilemma all nuclear weapons states face is that to maintain a credible nuclear force, be it a force of one or one thousand nuclear warheads on deployment, a massive military industrial complex must be maintained. As well as building the actual nuclear weapon systems, it must also provide the conventional defence screen consisting of fighter jets, patrols planes, anti-submarine warfare technology etc. In an ultimate irony, the purpose of these becomes to defend the nuclear forces to ensure a second strike can be launched rather than to defend people, because there is no defence against a determined nuclear attack. The military industrial complex that delivers this equipment must be continually fed with new streams of contracts at increasing values otherwise the industrial complex collapses. Thus a key objective in the initial gate document which justified to parliament the early procurement of material for Trident was that, \u201cWe must retain the capability to design, build and support nuclear submarines and meet the commitment for a successor to the Vanguard Class submarines.\u201d In other words, we build Tridents to continue building Tridents.\nThe enormous cost of this needs to be covered by taxes, and for this some \u00a3500 billion of additional excess economic activity is needed which requires energy from fossil fuels and is the antithesis of making the urgent cut backs we need to tackle the soaring greenhouse gas overburden. Thus once the decision is made to proceed with Trident, it becomes impossible to make the climate change agreements to save the planet. In this context Trident is more dangerous than we ever first thought and it is the ultimate Faustian bargain.\nYour commissioners have also failed to acknowledge in their report that the public spending that will be needed on Trident must be made at the same times as scarce public funds must be diverted to building a low carbon economy and mitigating the effects of climate change such as flooding and storm damage. This conflict will arise as tax receipts simultaneously drop through energy price rises.\n\u2026to build at huge expense a nuclear force whilst the nation is effectively bankrupt that will never provide secure protection from nuclear attack and merely encourage our competitors to reciprocate. It drives a race to the bottom where rational decisions on climate change can never be taken.\n\u2026Electricity usage by the military, which accounts for even more greenhouse gas emissions, is also gargantuan. In FY 2006, the DoD used almost 30,000 gigawatt hours of electricity at a cost of almost $2.2 billion. The DoD\u2019s electricity use would supply enough electricity to power more than 2.6 million average American homes.\n\u2026The increased propensity for war and conflict brought about by global warming is being exploited by the military-industrial complex which is planning on how to profit from it. Defense contractors are looking at climate change as a growth and profit opportunity due to the potential conflicts produced by food and water shortages. They are salivating over the potential profits to be made leading to increased stock market performance and, therefore, higher CEO compensation.\nYes, where is the evolution? Teeming within the capitalist industrial civilization that is M.A.D. are 7+ billion naked apes, the most dangerous creature to ever walk the face of the Earth capable of wiping itself out within mere minutes from thermonuclear war, if anthropogenic climate disruption, ocean acidification, and global nuclear reactor meltdowns don\u2019t do the trick.\nFor a glimpse into the life of someone who is actually doing the dangerous and solitary work of true investigative reporting, exposing the dark underbelly of Western imperialism and global capitalism, please read the recent blog post of Andre Vltchek and support his work.\nAndre Vltchek. D.R.\nIt is late at night and you cannot sleep. Ebrie Lagoon is right behind the window of your hotel, but it is hardly visible at this hour. You are in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, West Africa.\nOne of the most costly, self-inflicted wounds engineered by techno-capitalist man is the never-ending Fukushima nuclear disaster. The groundwork for epic failure at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant began in the 1960\u2019s when TEPCO bulldozed 25 meters off of a 35-meter-high hill in order to facilitate the delivery and set up of the plant\u2019s large equipment, which was delivered by boat, as well as to provide easier and cheaper access to seawater used as a coolant pumped through the reactors. TEPCO then dug even further downward another 14 feet to construct the basement where emergency diesel generators would be installed. Decades later a tsunami would easily flood this area, knocking out the emergency electrical back-up generator and making nuclear meltdown a certainty.\nThe last line of defense in preventing the ionizing alpha, beta and gamma radiation and radioisotopes inside melting fuel rods from spewing out into the environment is the containment vessel. The poor design of the now ruptured Mark 1 containment vessel in Fukushima is most certainly contributing to the ongoing disaster there. The U.S. apparently has 23 reactors just like the ones that melted down in Fukushima as well as the risky storage of spent fuel rods next to the reactor building itself.\nWhen the T\u014dhoku tsunami struck at Fukushima, reports describe chaos and incompetency as workers had to bring protective gear and manuals from distant buildings as well as borrow equipment from contractors. The failure of the Japanese government and TEPCO to imagine such a catastrophic event and guard against it is highlighted by the fact that this exact scenario was predicted in a Japanese magna comic book.\n\u2026When officials from the nuclear safety agency or the ministry came to the plant for inspections, they were entertained with drinks the night before. Then they would inspect the plant and give it a hundred per cent pass mark. Then on the way home the inspectors were given beer and snacks and taxi vouchers.\nTokyo has been able to essentially buy the support, or at least the silent acquiescence, of communities by showering them with generous subsidies, payouts and jobs. In 2009 alone, Tokyo gave $1.15 billion for public works projects to communities that have electric plants, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Experts say the majority of that money goes to communities near nuclear plants.\nAnd that is just the tip of the iceberg, experts say, as the communities also receive a host of subsidies, property and income tax revenues, compensation to individuals and even \u201canonymous\u201d donations to local treasuries that are widely believed to come from plant operators.\nUnquestionably, the aid has enriched rural communities that were rapidly losing jobs and people to the cities. With no substantial reserves of oil or coal, Japan relies on nuclear power for the energy needed to drive its economic machine. But critics contend that the largess has also made communities dependent on central government spending \u2014 and thus unwilling to rock the boat by pushing for robust safety measures.\n\u2026Japan\u2019s power-supply industry, collectively, is Japan\u2019s biggest advertiser, spending \u00a588 billion (more than $1 billion) a year, according to the Nikkei Advertising Research Institute. Tepco\u2019s \u00a524.4 billion alone is roughly half what a global firm as large as Toyota spends in a year.\nMembers of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan since 1955 except for a year in the 1990s and for a three-year period ending in 2012, have been rewarded for their pro-nuclear stance with campaign donations from the ten giant electrical utilities that control around 96 percent of the nation\u2019s power supply.\nThe largest of these, the Tokyo Electric Power Company or Tepco, formally ended its direct corporate donations in 1974. But it systematically encouraged \u201cvoluntary\u201d donations by company executives and managers to a fund-raising entity created by the ruling party, according to a 2011 investigation by Asahi. At least 448 Tepco executives donated roughly $777,000 in total to the entity between 1995 and 2009, according to documents obtained by Asahi and shared with the Center.\nTepco\u2019s influence has also been enhanced by its enthusiastic participation in revolving door-employment practices similar to those involving bureaucrats and companies in Washington, D.C.\nPerhaps the most significant instance of ama-agari was the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s appointment in 1998 of Tokio Kano, a longtime Tepco executive, as chairman of the parliamentary committee that oversees METI and as the parliamentary secretary of science and technology. Both are posts crucial to the nuclear energy industry, and Kano used them to advance legislation enabling plutonium-based fuel to be burned in some standard reactors \u2014 not just breeders. He also pushed through a law requiring that all spent nuclear fuel be sent to Rokkasho or similar Japanese plants.\n\u2026The list included people with power in the opposition parties, such as the former prime minister Naoto Kan and the politician Ishiro Ozawa, and I was told that my name, Mako Oshidori, was listed alongside these names. A researcher who was given the list and told not to approach anybody on it was friendly with me and told me the list included my name. Soon after that a mysterious man began to follow me. This man appeared to be a member of Public Security Intelligence Agency in the Cabinet Office, which investigates various things. One of my hobbies is taking a candid shot, and I will show you the successful candid shot of this man.\nExports of nuclear components and technology, as well as conventional arms, are potentially key elements of \u201cAbenomics\u201d and much is riding on the outcome. In 2013, Abe concluded Japan\u2019s first nuclear reactor export agreement with Turkey for $22 billion and others are pending with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, while the prime minister has also lobbied governments in Central Europe, Vietnam and Indonesia. This is a remarkable turnaround from 2011 when the prospects for post-Fukushima Japan relying on nuclear energy, let alone exporting it, looked unlikely.\nThe seeds for Japan\u2019s nuclear hara-kiri were planted back in the early 1950\u2019s when the American government hatched a propaganda campaign of developing an \u201catoms for peace\u201d mission in Japan to foster pro-nuclear sentiment and help rebuild their economy using such technology.\nThe US-Japan Security Treaty of 1960 stipulates that an attack on Japan will be regarded as an attack on the United States. Prime Minister Abe is seeking to transform Japan\u2019s constitution to permit engagement of the Japanese armed forces in aggressive wars. But it is difficult to imagine a resurgent military posture by Japan without tacit encouragement from Washington.\nThe highest stage of monopoly capitalism is fascism. The 2008 global economic crisis of capitalism, still unresolved, is forcing ill-advised and counterproductive \u201causterity measures\u201d on decaying capitalist societies throughout Europe and in Japan, where Prime Minister Abe is restructuring the economy into the very pro-market system which is producing riots throughout Western Europe, as living standards deteriorate drastically, and the income inequality gap becomes an abyss.\nSome ask why Hiroshima and Nagasaki were rebuilt and repopulated so soon after a nuclear bomb blast, yet Fukushima and Chernobyl remain unsafe to inhabit into the indefinite future. The answer lies in the vast difference of irradiating potential between a nuclear bomb and a nuclear reactor.\nThe nuclear bombs used in World War II were detonated roughly 2,000 feet above ground and their radioisotopes were carried by the wind and dispersed over a very large area. The nuclear bomb called \u201cLittle Boy\u201d used over Hiroshima contained only 140 pounds of fissionable material (Uranium-235) and \u201cFat Man\u201d used over Nagasaki contained just 14 pounds of Plutonium-239. These are minute amounts of radioisotopes when compared to the 180 tons of nuclear fuel at Chernobyl and the staggering 1,600 tons at Fukushima. Explosions and meltdowns at nuclear reactors occur at ground level, creating more radioactive isotopes due to neutron activation with the soils while spreading their radiation across the planet, year after year after year. Today the background radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is said to be the same as the global average anywhere on Earth. Ground zero at Chernobyl and Fukushima won\u2019t be habitable for 20,000 years or longer. Nuclear bombs kill hundreds of thousands of people instantly while a nuclear reactor meltdown kills people over years, decades, and generations.\nThe too-big-to-fail TEPCO is now building the Great Ice Wall of Japan to stem the flow of tons of contaminated water that they have been hastily storing in hundreds of haphazardly constructed containers.\nNuclear plants were originally given a license to operate for 40 years, and in the late 1990s, the NRC began accepting applications to extend those licenses for an additional 20 years. While it\u2019s not clear how many current plants will still be operating in 2100, most facilities store their nuclear waste on-site, where it can continue to emit radiation for thousands of years. There is currently no long-term national storage site for spent nuclear fuel in the U.S., as Congress cut the funding to build such a facility at Nevada\u2019s Yucca Mountain in 2011. While there are no near-term plans to remove nuclear waste from the coastal plants threatened by rising seas, \u201cthe expectation is that [waste] won\u2019t remain on-site,\u201d said NRC Senior Public Affairs Officer Roger Hannah.\nDespite the increased risk of flooding due to rising sea levels, some plant operators have not factored this into their long-term plans. In 2010, when Florida Power and Light Company applied for a license to build two additional reactors at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station in Homestead, Florida, the NRC asked the plant\u2019s owners to explain \u201chow potential sea-level rise due to potential future climate change is accounted for\u201d in their plans, NRC documents show. The company declined to discuss climate change in its analysis, and used a projection that assumed a constant sea level rise of just 1 foot per century, which is 5.6 feet lower than NOAA\u2019s worst-case projection for 2100.\nThe risks to the ocean, in particular, are unprecedented because there is good reason to believe that melted fuel residing in, or below, the reactor basements is in direct contact with an underground river running through the site (Nagata, 2013).\nA German study modelling the effects of an uncontained core meltdown suggests the Pacific Ocean is imperiled. The \u201cGerman Risk Study, Phase B\u201d found that a core meltdown accident could result in complete failures of all structural containment, causing melted fuel to exit the reactor foundation within five days (cited in Bayer, Tromm, & Al-Omari 1989). Moreover, the study found that even in the event of an intact building foundation, passing groundwater would be in direct contact with fuel, causing leaching of fission products. Strontium leaches slower than cesium. A follow-up German study, \u201cDispersion of Radionuclides and Radiation Exposure after Leaching by Groundwater of a Solidified Core-Concrete Melt,\u201d predicted that strontium contamination levels would rise exponentially years after a full melt-through located adjacent to a river (Bayer, Tromm, & Al-Omari, 1989).\nThe study predicted concentrations of Strontium-90 in river water would spike relatively suddenly, but maintain extraordinarily high levels of contamination for years. Strontium bio-accumulates in the human body, including the brain, and is a known genotoxin. The study\u2019s experimental conditions are roughly similar to Daiichi\u2019s site conditions and strontium levels have been spiking there since the summer of 2013. TEPCO just reported that strontium levels in reactor basement water ranged from 40 million to 500 million becquerels per liter (\u201cTEPCO to Improve,\u201d 2014).\n", "prompt": " I won\u2019t waste anyone\u2019s time analyzing the verbiage of this so-called agreement which failed to even mention the term fossil fuels, probably at the behest of those who financed the entire farce, i.e. the carbon-extraction companies. Suffice it to say that countries were approving fossil fuel exploration projects before the ink of the global climate agreement had fully dried. As long as corporations are able to push environmental and social costs off their balance sheets and onto the backs of the weak and defenseless, dirty coal will be burnt and the cheapest slave labor will be employed. Questioning root causes like our inherently unsustainable way of life is still very much taboo and will remain so even after our descendants are sifting through the wreckage. Sure, mainstream publications have expanded their coverage of man-made climate change and global warming, but these existential threats to life on Earth remain an enigma to the vast majority, a footnote in some obscure textbook.\nYes, we are pretty far gone when a four minute comedy routine makes more sense than anything broadcasted on the evening news. Corporate mass media-controlled public debates have degenerated into infomercial sound bites. In a society where success is measured by the key metrics of money and profit, it should be no surprise that a wealthy, xenophobic businessman is able to garner mass appeal by hogging publicity and playing on the fears and base desires of the populus. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is a catchy slogan for a society ignorant of the collapsing world around them and oblivious to the over-consumptive, profligate way of life that is proving to be their undoing. For a celebrity-obsessed culture whose world is falling apart, the next logical choice for its leader would seem to be a reality TV show star who says he can restore the illusion of the American dream and build a great wall to keep all the riff-raff out.\nSo while terrorism takes center stage in the overstretched Empire of Amnesia, remember this simple fact: 303 Americans were killed in terrorist attacks worldwide in the last decade while 320,523 Americans were killed because of gun violence in that same time period. Random mass shootings, capitalism\u2019s \u201cfree market\u201d genocides, the disruption of the Holocene\u2019s stable climate regime by anthropogenic climate disruption, tipping points in the earth\u2019s biosphere, terminal industrial disease, and many other things come to mind that pose a much bigger danger to the average American, but the War on Terror, conceived as open-ended, serves as a conveniently omnipresent boogieman for jerking the chain of the taxpayer and justifying the growth of an intrusive security state. What better way to control the masses as the wheels continue coming off the global economy and the biosphere becomes evermore threadbare. The rich will retreat into their luxury spider holes until the coast is clear.\nPsychological concepts of how we view the world around us, including \u2018creeping normalcy\u2019 or \u2018landscape amnesia\u2019, block day-to-day comprehension of what accelerating human activities represent\u2014whether it is human population, the number of dammed rivers, forest destruction, or the impact of motor car emissions in a timespan that is geologically brief. Creeping normalcy refers to slow trends concealed in noisy fluctuations that people get used to without comment, while landscape amnesia describes forgetting how different the landscape looked 20\u201350 years ago (Diamond 2005: 425).\nAt some point in your life you realize that you\u2019re running out of time, that your health and energy level are slipping, and that your time here on Earth is extremely fragile and transient. You begin to question and re-evaluate what\u2019s important to you. Most still go to their grave with the belief that life will go on for their descendants in a world of never-ending technological \u201cadvancements\u201d and improvements in society. A few reading this blog understand the myth of human progress and that mankind is sleepwalking towards a very dark fate. How could there be any other outcome when we have never really heeded the precautionary principle of environmentalism and, in fact, flagrantly disregarded it? Occasionally a scientist will candidly speak the truth. Recently, Jason Box did just that when he tweeted \u201cwe\u2019re f\u2019d\u201d if just a small fraction of floor carbon is released from the Arctic. Some of us realize what dire straits we are in and all we can really do is watch with a sort of morbid fascination as this dystopian future unfolds before our eyes. A \u201cgrim meathook future\u201d is the inevitable result of a society that worships money, materialism, militarism, and technology.\nFor an articulate and heartfelt expression of the angst of the modern age, I highly recommend reading the blog post Everyone I know is brokenhearted. The author, Josh Ellis, doesn\u2019t mention climate change at all, but he does hit on every other aspect of capitalist industrial civilization and its soul-crushing, alienating culture. Judging from the number of Facebook \u201clikes\u201d, now at 21K and counting, he has really struck a nerve with people. Perhaps it\u2019s fitting and somewhat ironic that Josh has spent much time in the desert megacity of Las Vegas, the ultimate man-made mirage of capitalist decadence.\nAll the genuinely smart, talented, funny people I know seem to be miserable these days. You feel it on Twitter more than Facebook, because Facebook is where you go to do your performance art where you pretend to be a hip, urbane person with the most awesomest friends and the best relationships and the very best lunches ever. Facebook is surface; Twitter is subtext, and judging by what I\u2019ve seen, the subtext is aching sadness.\nI\u2019m not immune to this.  I think a lot about killing myself these days. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to do it and this isn\u2019t a cry for help. But I wake up and think: fuck, more of this? Really? How much more? And is it really worth it?\nThe Blood-Soaked Foreign Policy of the U.S.\nCitizens of the First World live in ignorance of their country\u2019s violent imperialistic history. As Joe Bageant said, \u201cAmericans are cultivated like mushrooms from birth to death, kept in the dark and fed horseshit.\u201d Nonetheless, the average pleb in America should realize by now that they too will be treated no different from those in the Third World exploited by empire. As illustrated by a recent study, U.S. citizens are mere cardboard cutouts in a fa\u00e7ade of democracy with essentially no voice in their government\u2019s actions. The wealthy elite call the shots, determining crucial government policy and the law of the land. When all the propaganda and myths are swept aside, America is revealed to be nothing more than a heartless oligarchy; you and I are simply marketing statistics and consumers, pawns and cogs within capitalist industrial civilization.\n\u2026The improved leverage of US power over Mexico\u2019s economy is not solely an issue of having a workforce so \u2018flexible\u2019 that much of it is forced into sweatshop labour. The maquiladora belt functions effectively as an economic colony, with the local Mexican police, paid for by the Mexican taxpayer, providing the \u2018security\u2019 necessary for factories to operate unhindered by nuisance unions and human rights activists.\nOne of Mexico\u2019s chief exports, then, is labour. Just as profits and goods leave the country, significant amounts of labour time are not reflected in the Mexican economy. Corporations benefit enormously from this win-win situation resulting in the continuing breakdown of society, a state of affairs reminiscent of a colonial economy, albeit without foreign control of what in any case is a pliant government. As a result, Mexican workers in the maquiladoras, notes Delgado-Wise, are little more than \u2018manpower for foreign capital\u2019.\n\u2026With the authorities weakened, the line between the state and the narcotics industry is becoming increasingly blurred. A United Nations report estimated that between 50 and 60 percent of Mexican municipal government offices have been \u2018captured or feudalised\u2019 and coopted by narcotrafficking organisations. Mexican intelligence estimates that 62 percent of the Mexican police are presently under the control of the narco trade. According to rank and effectiveness, members of the police forces can receive anywhere between 5 to 70 thousand pesos monthly from cartels, a dramatic net increase on their state salaries. Of the 2.9 million arms given to the Mexican police forces, 57 percent are used in illicit activities.\n\u2026Historian Miguel Tinker Salas has noted that in the case of Plan Colombia, military spending was intended to crush the strength of rural insurgents and guerrillas to offset the possibility of a popular rebellion, particularly as Colombia had among the worst levels of inequality in Latin America. In Mexico, maintaining a status quo which sees unprecedented levels of inequality and widespread poverty \u2013 exacerbated since the 1980s \u2013 is likely to involve the increasing use of force in order to quash the threat to the established order posed by social movements and popular revolt, all the more real as Mexico inches closer to collapse. Increasing attacks on organisers and activists of the anti-capitalist Zapatista initiative, La otra campa\u00f1a, in Chiapas and the prolonged assault on inhabitants of Oaxaca in 2006 remind us that the state will always use military might to repress challenges to its authority and to the socio-economic order. US training of the Mexican military should be viewed in this light, bearing in mind that imperialism has two arms in Latin America \u2013 one military, the other economic.\nAll the coffee-producing countries of Central America have seen drops in production of 30% or more in each of the past two years. Some, such as Guatemala, report rising cases of chronic malnutrition in coffee workers\u2019 children. Last week Oxfam cited coffee among other crops in a report that warned climate change was putting back the global fight against hunger \u201cby decades\u201d.\nNicaragua\u2019s problem is particularly acute. Along with neighbouring Honduras, and Burma, it is already one of the three countries most affected by climate change, according to the 2013 Global Climate Risk Index. Nearly a third of its working population, about 750,000 people, depend on coffee directly or indirectly for a living. Coffee provides 20% of GDP. The Nicaraguan government is deeply worried: it has predicted that, because of falling rainfall and rising temperatures, by 2050 80% of its current coffee growing areas will no longer be usable.\nWarmer temperatures are also threatening a genetically diverse type of coffee called Arabica which is considered essential to the industry and comprises 70% of global coffee production. According to a recent study, by 2080 global warming will make two-thirds of today\u2019s farms too hot to grow Arabica.\nIn sharp contrast, Nicaragua, an equally poor country that receives far less U.S. aid because of our government\u2019s hostility toward the Sandinistas, sends far fewer children across the U.S. border. Why? Since coming back into power in 2006, the Sandinistas have enacted strong programs designed to allow the poor to become self-sufficient.\nThe only way to actually fix the immigration crisis is to address the root causes I have identified above. The response to date from the U.S. government has been to request billions in detention center and deportation funds, launch a PR campaign in the media of Central American countries to dissuade illegal immigration, and increase spending in law enforcement aid through CARSI (Central America Regional Security Initiative). Meanwhile, right-wing politicians fan the flames of racism and xenophobia with calls for militarizing the border to stop the hoards of swarthy barbarians at America\u2019s doorstep. In reality, the current deteriorating social conditions in Central and South America are a direct result of the American corporatocracy and its rapacious economic system as well as anthropogenic climate disruption. The child migrants flooding across America\u2019s border are, to a great degree, victims of U.S. foreign policy and climate change.\nWhere\u2019s the Evolution?\nInsects, birds, mammals, and fish have all been migrating to cooler zones for the past four decades in response to the cataclysmic climate disruption ignited by industrial civilization, but humans are the only organisms inhabiting this blue orb we call Earth who are not altering their behavior. They live within an energy cocoon that keeps them cool in the summer, warm in the winter, stuffed with massed produced food from mechanized factory farms, and entertained by a virtual world of digital imagery. As cracks and holes in the Earth\u2019s biosphere grow ever larger, the natural response of capitalist carbon man ensconced within his protective energy shell is to try to put a price tag on what is being burned, i.e. fossil fuels, rather than deal with the deeper root cause of an unsustainable economic system and way of life which demands such exorbitant consumption of resources.\nOur energy slaves feed us and control the climate for us while at the same time destroying the natural world that had enabled humans to create such an artificial environment. Detached from nature and enslaved by our own technological creations, we sleepwalk over the cliff of extinction. Our so-called progress will, in the end, disappear like a mirage in the scorching desert sun as nature is sacrificed to the machine of industrial civilization.\nThrowing money into the maw of the \u2018free market\u2019 is the predictable modus operandi of technocapitalism\u2019s indoctrinated disciples who believe such offerings will create a technofix, miraculously healing the planet. In the Star Trek TV series, the Ferengi were an extraterrestrial race whose culture was characterized by \u201ca mercantile obsession with profit and trade, and their constant efforts to swindle unwary customers into unfair deals.\u201d Just like the Ferengi species where profit is the first, last and only important factor, the high temples of private enterprise are commodifying and monetizing the atmosphere just as they have everything else in nature. The colonization of the public mind by capitalism is complete and overriding. We ignore unfolding geologic forces and instead put our faith in manmade market forces to our detriment.\n\u2026The fundamental dilemma all nuclear weapons states face is that to maintain a credible nuclear force, be it a force of one or one thousand nuclear warheads on deployment, a massive military industrial complex must be maintained. As well as building the actual nuclear weapon systems, it must also provide the conventional defence screen consisting of fighter jets, patrols planes, anti-submarine warfare technology etc. In an ultimate irony, the purpose of these becomes to defend the nuclear forces to ensure a second strike can be launched rather than to defend people, because there is no defence against a determined nuclear attack. The military industrial complex that delivers this equipment must be continually fed with new streams of contracts at increasing values otherwise the industrial complex collapses. Thus a key objective in the initial gate document which justified to parliament the early procurement of material for Trident was that, \u201cWe must retain the capability to design, build and support nuclear submarines and meet the commitment for a successor to the Vanguard Class submarines.\u201d In other words, we build Tridents to continue building Tridents.\nThe enormous cost of this needs to be covered by taxes, and for this some \u00a3500 billion of additional excess economic activity is needed which requires energy from fossil fuels and is the antithesis of making the urgent cut backs we need to tackle the soaring greenhouse gas overburden. Thus once the decision is made to proceed with Trident, it becomes impossible to make the climate change agreements to save the planet. In this context Trident is more dangerous than we ever first thought and it is the ultimate Faustian bargain.\nYour commissioners have also failed to acknowledge in their report that the public spending that will be needed on Trident must be made at the same times as scarce public funds must be diverted to building a low carbon economy and mitigating the effects of climate change such as flooding and storm damage. This conflict will arise as tax receipts simultaneously drop through energy price rises.\n\u2026to build at huge expense a nuclear force whilst the nation is effectively bankrupt that will never provide secure protection from nuclear attack and merely encourage our competitors to reciprocate. It drives a race to the bottom where rational decisions on climate change can never be taken.\n\u2026Electricity usage by the military, which accounts for even more greenhouse gas emissions, is also gargantuan. In FY 2006, the DoD used almost 30,000 gigawatt hours of electricity at a cost of almost $2.2 billion. The DoD\u2019s electricity use would supply enough electricity to power more than 2.6 million average American homes.\n\u2026The increased propensity for war and conflict brought about by global warming is being exploited by the military-industrial complex which is planning on how to profit from it. Defense contractors are looking at climate change as a growth and profit opportunity due to the potential conflicts produced by food and water shortages. They are salivating over the potential profits to be made leading to increased stock market performance and, therefore, higher CEO compensation.\nYes, where is the evolution? Teeming within the capitalist industrial civilization that is M.A.D. are 7+ billion naked apes, the most dangerous creature to ever walk the face of the Earth capable of wiping itself out within mere minutes from thermonuclear war, if anthropogenic climate disruption, ocean acidification, and global nuclear reactor meltdowns don\u2019t do the trick.\nFor a glimpse into the life of someone who is actually doing the dangerous and solitary work of true investigative reporting, exposing the dark underbelly of Western imperialism and global capitalism, please read the recent blog post of Andre Vltchek and support his work.\nAndre Vltchek. D.R.\nIt is late at night and you cannot sleep. Ebrie Lagoon is right behind the window of your hotel, but it is hardly visible at this hour. You are in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, West Africa.\nOne of the most costly, self-inflicted wounds engineered by techno-capitalist man is the never-ending Fukushima nuclear disaster. The groundwork for epic failure at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant began in the 1960\u2019s when TEPCO bulldozed 25 meters off of a 35-meter-high hill in order to facilitate the delivery and set up of the plant\u2019s large equipment, which was delivered by boat, as well as to provide easier and cheaper access to seawater used as a coolant pumped through the reactors. TEPCO then dug even further downward another 14 feet to construct the basement where emergency diesel generators would be installed. Decades later a tsunami would easily flood this area, knocking out the emergency electrical back-up generator and making nuclear meltdown a certainty.\nThe last line of defense in preventing the ionizing alpha, beta and gamma radiation and radioisotopes inside melting fuel rods from spewing out into the environment is the containment vessel. The poor design of the now ruptured Mark 1 containment vessel in Fukushima is most certainly contributing to the ongoing disaster there. The U.S. apparently has 23 reactors just like the ones that melted down in Fukushima as well as the risky storage of spent fuel rods next to the reactor building itself.\nWhen the T\u014dhoku tsunami struck at Fukushima, reports describe chaos and incompetency as workers had to bring protective gear and manuals from distant buildings as well as borrow equipment from contractors. The failure of the Japanese government and TEPCO to imagine such a catastrophic event and guard against it is highlighted by the fact that this exact scenario was predicted in a Japanese magna comic book.\n\u2026When officials from the nuclear safety agency or the ministry came to the plant for inspections, they were entertained with drinks the night before. Then they would inspect the plant and give it a hundred per cent pass mark. Then on the way home the inspectors were given beer and snacks and taxi vouchers.\nTokyo has been able to essentially buy the support, or at least the silent acquiescence, of communities by showering them with generous subsidies, payouts and jobs. In 2009 alone, Tokyo gave $1.15 billion for public works projects to communities that have electric plants, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Experts say the majority of that money goes to communities near nuclear plants.\nAnd that is just the tip of the iceberg, experts say, as the communities also receive a host of subsidies, property and income tax revenues, compensation to individuals and even \u201canonymous\u201d donations to local treasuries that are widely believed to come from plant operators.\nUnquestionably, the aid has enriched rural communities that were rapidly losing jobs and people to the cities. With no substantial reserves of oil or coal, Japan relies on nuclear power for the energy needed to drive its economic machine. But critics contend that the largess has also made communities dependent on central government spending \u2014 and thus unwilling to rock the boat by pushing for robust safety measures.\n\u2026Japan\u2019s power-supply industry, collectively, is Japan\u2019s biggest advertiser, spending \u00a588 billion (more than $1 billion) a year, according to the Nikkei Advertising Research Institute. Tepco\u2019s \u00a524.4 billion alone is roughly half what a global firm as large as Toyota spends in a year.\nMembers of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan since 1955 except for a year in the 1990s and for a three-year period ending in 2012, have been rewarded for their pro-nuclear stance with campaign donations from the ten giant electrical utilities that control around 96 percent of the nation\u2019s power supply.\nThe largest of these, the Tokyo Electric Power Company or Tepco, formally ended its direct corporate donations in 1974. But it systematically encouraged \u201cvoluntary\u201d donations by company executives and managers to a fund-raising entity created by the ruling party, according to a 2011 investigation by Asahi. At least 448 Tepco executives donated roughly $777,000 in total to the entity between 1995 and 2009, according to documents obtained by Asahi and shared with the Center.\nTepco\u2019s influence has also been enhanced by its enthusiastic participation in revolving door-employment practices similar to those involving bureaucrats and companies in Washington, D.C.\nPerhaps the most significant instance of ama-agari was the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s appointment in 1998 of Tokio Kano, a longtime Tepco executive, as chairman of the parliamentary committee that oversees METI and as the parliamentary secretary of science and technology. Both are posts crucial to the nuclear energy industry, and Kano used them to advance legislation enabling plutonium-based fuel to be burned in some standard reactors \u2014 not just breeders. He also pushed through a law requiring that all spent nuclear fuel be sent to Rokkasho or similar Japanese plants.\n\u2026The list included people with power in the opposition parties, such as the former prime minister Naoto Kan and the politician Ishiro Ozawa, and I was told that my name, Mako Oshidori, was listed alongside these names. A researcher who was given the list and told not to approach anybody on it was friendly with me and told me the list included my name. Soon after that a mysterious man began to follow me. This man appeared to be a member of Public Security Intelligence Agency in the Cabinet Office, which investigates various things. One of my hobbies is taking a candid shot, and I will show you the successful candid shot of this man.\nExports of nuclear components and technology, as well as conventional arms, are potentially key elements of \u201cAbenomics\u201d and much is riding on the outcome. In 2013, Abe concluded Japan\u2019s first nuclear reactor export agreement with Turkey for $22 billion and others are pending with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, while the prime minister has also lobbied governments in Central Europe, Vietnam and Indonesia. This is a remarkable turnaround from 2011 when the prospects for post-Fukushima Japan relying on nuclear energy, let alone exporting it, looked unlikely.\nThe seeds for Japan\u2019s nuclear hara-kiri were planted back in the early 1950\u2019s when the American government hatched a propaganda campaign of developing an \u201catoms for peace\u201d mission in Japan to foster pro-nuclear sentiment and help rebuild their economy using such technology.\nThe US-Japan Security Treaty of 1960 stipulates that an attack on Japan will be regarded as an attack on the United States. Prime Minister Abe is seeking to transform Japan\u2019s constitution to permit engagement of the Japanese armed forces in aggressive wars. But it is difficult to imagine a resurgent military posture by Japan without tacit encouragement from Washington.\nThe highest stage of monopoly capitalism is fascism. The 2008 global economic crisis of capitalism, still unresolved, is forcing ill-advised and counterproductive \u201causterity measures\u201d on decaying capitalist societies throughout Europe and in Japan, where Prime Minister Abe is restructuring the economy into the very pro-market system which is producing riots throughout Western Europe, as living standards deteriorate drastically, and the income inequality gap becomes an abyss.\nSome ask why Hiroshima and Nagasaki were rebuilt and repopulated so soon after a nuclear bomb blast, yet Fukushima and Chernobyl remain unsafe to inhabit into the indefinite future. The answer lies in the vast difference of irradiating potential between a nuclear bomb and a nuclear reactor.\nThe nuclear bombs used in World War II were detonated roughly 2,000 feet above ground and their radioisotopes were carried by the wind and dispersed over a very large area. The nuclear bomb called \u201cLittle Boy\u201d used over Hiroshima contained only 140 pounds of fissionable material (Uranium-235) and \u201cFat Man\u201d used over Nagasaki contained just 14 pounds of Plutonium-239. These are minute amounts of radioisotopes when compared to the 180 tons of nuclear fuel at Chernobyl and the staggering 1,600 tons at Fukushima. Explosions and meltdowns at nuclear reactors occur at ground level, creating more radioactive isotopes due to neutron activation with the soils while spreading their radiation across the planet, year after year after year. Today the background radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is said to be the same as the global average anywhere on Earth. Ground zero at Chernobyl and Fukushima won\u2019t be habitable for 20,000 years or longer. Nuclear bombs kill hundreds of thousands of people instantly while a nuclear reactor meltdown kills people over years, decades, and generations.\nThe too-big-to-fail TEPCO is now building the Great Ice Wall of Japan to stem the flow of tons of contaminated water that they have been hastily storing in hundreds of haphazardly constructed containers.\nNuclear plants were originally given a license to operate for 40 years, and in the late 1990s, the NRC began accepting applications to extend those licenses for an additional 20 years. While it\u2019s not clear how many current plants will still be operating in 2100, most facilities store their nuclear waste on-site, where it can continue to emit radiation for thousands of years. There is currently no long-term national storage site for spent nuclear fuel in the U.S., as Congress cut the funding to build such a facility at Nevada\u2019s Yucca Mountain in 2011. While there are no near-term plans to remove nuclear waste from the coastal plants threatened by rising seas, \u201cthe expectation is that [waste] won\u2019t remain on-site,\u201d said NRC Senior Public Affairs Officer Roger Hannah.\nDespite the increased risk of flooding due to rising sea levels, some plant operators have not factored this into their long-term plans. In 2010, when Florida Power and Light Company applied for a license to build two additional reactors at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station in Homestead, Florida, the NRC asked the plant\u2019s owners to explain \u201chow potential sea-level rise due to potential future climate change is accounted for\u201d in their plans, NRC documents show. The company declined to discuss climate change in its analysis, and used a projection that assumed a constant sea level rise of just 1 foot per century, which is 5.6 feet lower than NOAA\u2019s worst-case projection for 2100.\nThe risks to the ocean, in particular, are unprecedented because there is good reason to believe that melted fuel residing in, or below, the reactor basements is in direct contact with an underground river running through the site (Nagata, 2013).\nA German study modelling the effects of an uncontained core meltdown suggests the Pacific Ocean is imperiled. The \u201cGerman Risk Study, Phase B\u201d found that a core meltdown accident could result in complete failures of all structural containment, causing melted fuel to exit the reactor foundation within five days (cited in Bayer, Tromm, & Al-Omari 1989). Moreover, the study found that even in the event of an intact building foundation, passing groundwater would be in direct contact with fuel, causing leaching of fission products. Strontium leaches slower than cesium. A follow-up German study, \u201cDispersion of Radionuclides and Radiation Exposure after Leaching by Groundwater of a Solidified Core-Concrete Melt,\u201d predicted that strontium contamination levels would rise exponentially years after a full melt-through located adjacent to a river (Bayer, Tromm, & Al-Omari, 1989).\nThe study predicted concentrations of Strontium-90 in river water would spike relatively suddenly, but maintain extraordinarily high levels of contamination for years. Strontium bio-accumulates in the human body, including the brain, and is a known genotoxin. The study\u2019s experimental conditions are roughly similar to Daiichi\u2019s site conditions and strontium levels have been spiking there since the summer of 2013. TEPCO just reported that strontium levels in reactor basement water ranged from 40 million to 500 million becquerels per liter (\u201cTEPCO to Improve,\u201d 2014).\n\nWrite a haiku:", "original_prompt": "Write a haiku:", "full_output": " I won\u2019t waste anyone\u2019s time analyzing the verbiage of this so-called agreement which failed to even mention the term fossil fuels, probably at the behest of those who financed the entire farce, i.e. the carbon-extraction companies. Suffice it to say that countries were approving fossil fuel exploration projects before the ink of the global climate agreement had fully dried. As long as corporations are able to push environmental and social costs off their balance sheets and onto the backs of the weak and defenseless, dirty coal will be burnt and the cheapest slave labor will be employed. Questioning root causes like our inherently unsustainable way of life is still very much taboo and will remain so even after our descendants are sifting through the wreckage. Sure, mainstream publications have expanded their coverage of man-made climate change and global warming, but these existential threats to life on Earth remain an enigma to the vast majority, a footnote in some obscure textbook.\nYes, we are pretty far gone when a four minute comedy routine makes more sense than anything broadcasted on the evening news. Corporate mass media-controlled public debates have degenerated into infomercial sound bites. In a society where success is measured by the key metrics of money and profit, it should be no surprise that a wealthy, xenophobic businessman is able to garner mass appeal by hogging publicity and playing on the fears and base desires of the populus. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is a catchy slogan for a society ignorant of the collapsing world around them and oblivious to the over-consumptive, profligate way of life that is proving to be their undoing. For a celebrity-obsessed culture whose world is falling apart, the next logical choice for its leader would seem to be a reality TV show star who says he can restore the illusion of the American dream and build a great wall to keep all the riff-raff out.\nSo while terrorism takes center stage in the overstretched Empire of Amnesia, remember this simple fact: 303 Americans were killed in terrorist attacks worldwide in the last decade while 320,523 Americans were killed because of gun violence in that same time period. Random mass shootings, capitalism\u2019s \u201cfree market\u201d genocides, the disruption of the Holocene\u2019s stable climate regime by anthropogenic climate disruption, tipping points in the earth\u2019s biosphere, terminal industrial disease, and many other things come to mind that pose a much bigger danger to the average American, but the War on Terror, conceived as open-ended, serves as a conveniently omnipresent boogieman for jerking the chain of the taxpayer and justifying the growth of an intrusive security state. What better way to control the masses as the wheels continue coming off the global economy and the biosphere becomes evermore threadbare. The rich will retreat into their luxury spider holes until the coast is clear.\nPsychological concepts of how we view the world around us, including \u2018creeping normalcy\u2019 or \u2018landscape amnesia\u2019, block day-to-day comprehension of what accelerating human activities represent\u2014whether it is human population, the number of dammed rivers, forest destruction, or the impact of motor car emissions in a timespan that is geologically brief. Creeping normalcy refers to slow trends concealed in noisy fluctuations that people get used to without comment, while landscape amnesia describes forgetting how different the landscape looked 20\u201350 years ago (Diamond 2005: 425).\nAt some point in your life you realize that you\u2019re running out of time, that your health and energy level are slipping, and that your time here on Earth is extremely fragile and transient. You begin to question and re-evaluate what\u2019s important to you. Most still go to their grave with the belief that life will go on for their descendants in a world of never-ending technological \u201cadvancements\u201d and improvements in society. A few reading this blog understand the myth of human progress and that mankind is sleepwalking towards a very dark fate. How could there be any other outcome when we have never really heeded the precautionary principle of environmentalism and, in fact, flagrantly disregarded it? Occasionally a scientist will candidly speak the truth. Recently, Jason Box did just that when he tweeted \u201cwe\u2019re f\u2019d\u201d if just a small fraction of floor carbon is released from the Arctic. Some of us realize what dire straits we are in and all we can really do is watch with a sort of morbid fascination as this dystopian future unfolds before our eyes. A \u201cgrim meathook future\u201d is the inevitable result of a society that worships money, materialism, militarism, and technology.\nFor an articulate and heartfelt expression of the angst of the modern age, I highly recommend reading the blog post Everyone I know is brokenhearted. The author, Josh Ellis, doesn\u2019t mention climate change at all, but he does hit on every other aspect of capitalist industrial civilization and its soul-crushing, alienating culture. Judging from the number of Facebook \u201clikes\u201d, now at 21K and counting, he has really struck a nerve with people. Perhaps it\u2019s fitting and somewhat ironic that Josh has spent much time in the desert megacity of Las Vegas, the ultimate man-made mirage of capitalist decadence.\nAll the genuinely smart, talented, funny people I know seem to be miserable these days. You feel it on Twitter more than Facebook, because Facebook is where you go to do your performance art where you pretend to be a hip, urbane person with the most awesomest friends and the best relationships and the very best lunches ever. Facebook is surface; Twitter is subtext, and judging by what I\u2019ve seen, the subtext is aching sadness.\nI\u2019m not immune to this.  I think a lot about killing myself these days. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to do it and this isn\u2019t a cry for help. But I wake up and think: fuck, more of this? Really? How much more? And is it really worth it?\nThe Blood-Soaked Foreign Policy of the U.S.\nCitizens of the First World live in ignorance of their country\u2019s violent imperialistic history. As Joe Bageant said, \u201cAmericans are cultivated like mushrooms from birth to death, kept in the dark and fed horseshit.\u201d Nonetheless, the average pleb in America should realize by now that they too will be treated no different from those in the Third World exploited by empire. As illustrated by a recent study, U.S. citizens are mere cardboard cutouts in a fa\u00e7ade of democracy with essentially no voice in their government\u2019s actions. The wealthy elite call the shots, determining crucial government policy and the law of the land. When all the propaganda and myths are swept aside, America is revealed to be nothing more than a heartless oligarchy; you and I are simply marketing statistics and consumers, pawns and cogs within capitalist industrial civilization.\n\u2026The improved leverage of US power over Mexico\u2019s economy is not solely an issue of having a workforce so \u2018flexible\u2019 that much of it is forced into sweatshop labour. The maquiladora belt functions effectively as an economic colony, with the local Mexican police, paid for by the Mexican taxpayer, providing the \u2018security\u2019 necessary for factories to operate unhindered by nuisance unions and human rights activists.\nOne of Mexico\u2019s chief exports, then, is labour. Just as profits and goods leave the country, significant amounts of labour time are not reflected in the Mexican economy. Corporations benefit enormously from this win-win situation resulting in the continuing breakdown of society, a state of affairs reminiscent of a colonial economy, albeit without foreign control of what in any case is a pliant government. As a result, Mexican workers in the maquiladoras, notes Delgado-Wise, are little more than \u2018manpower for foreign capital\u2019.\n\u2026With the authorities weakened, the line between the state and the narcotics industry is becoming increasingly blurred. A United Nations report estimated that between 50 and 60 percent of Mexican municipal government offices have been \u2018captured or feudalised\u2019 and coopted by narcotrafficking organisations. Mexican intelligence estimates that 62 percent of the Mexican police are presently under the control of the narco trade. According to rank and effectiveness, members of the police forces can receive anywhere between 5 to 70 thousand pesos monthly from cartels, a dramatic net increase on their state salaries. Of the 2.9 million arms given to the Mexican police forces, 57 percent are used in illicit activities.\n\u2026Historian Miguel Tinker Salas has noted that in the case of Plan Colombia, military spending was intended to crush the strength of rural insurgents and guerrillas to offset the possibility of a popular rebellion, particularly as Colombia had among the worst levels of inequality in Latin America. In Mexico, maintaining a status quo which sees unprecedented levels of inequality and widespread poverty \u2013 exacerbated since the 1980s \u2013 is likely to involve the increasing use of force in order to quash the threat to the established order posed by social movements and popular revolt, all the more real as Mexico inches closer to collapse. Increasing attacks on organisers and activists of the anti-capitalist Zapatista initiative, La otra campa\u00f1a, in Chiapas and the prolonged assault on inhabitants of Oaxaca in 2006 remind us that the state will always use military might to repress challenges to its authority and to the socio-economic order. US training of the Mexican military should be viewed in this light, bearing in mind that imperialism has two arms in Latin America \u2013 one military, the other economic.\nAll the coffee-producing countries of Central America have seen drops in production of 30% or more in each of the past two years. Some, such as Guatemala, report rising cases of chronic malnutrition in coffee workers\u2019 children. Last week Oxfam cited coffee among other crops in a report that warned climate change was putting back the global fight against hunger \u201cby decades\u201d.\nNicaragua\u2019s problem is particularly acute. Along with neighbouring Honduras, and Burma, it is already one of the three countries most affected by climate change, according to the 2013 Global Climate Risk Index. Nearly a third of its working population, about 750,000 people, depend on coffee directly or indirectly for a living. Coffee provides 20% of GDP. The Nicaraguan government is deeply worried: it has predicted that, because of falling rainfall and rising temperatures, by 2050 80% of its current coffee growing areas will no longer be usable.\nWarmer temperatures are also threatening a genetically diverse type of coffee called Arabica which is considered essential to the industry and comprises 70% of global coffee production. According to a recent study, by 2080 global warming will make two-thirds of today\u2019s farms too hot to grow Arabica.\nIn sharp contrast, Nicaragua, an equally poor country that receives far less U.S. aid because of our government\u2019s hostility toward the Sandinistas, sends far fewer children across the U.S. border. Why? Since coming back into power in 2006, the Sandinistas have enacted strong programs designed to allow the poor to become self-sufficient.\nThe only way to actually fix the immigration crisis is to address the root causes I have identified above. The response to date from the U.S. government has been to request billions in detention center and deportation funds, launch a PR campaign in the media of Central American countries to dissuade illegal immigration, and increase spending in law enforcement aid through CARSI (Central America Regional Security Initiative). Meanwhile, right-wing politicians fan the flames of racism and xenophobia with calls for militarizing the border to stop the hoards of swarthy barbarians at America\u2019s doorstep. In reality, the current deteriorating social conditions in Central and South America are a direct result of the American corporatocracy and its rapacious economic system as well as anthropogenic climate disruption. The child migrants flooding across America\u2019s border are, to a great degree, victims of U.S. foreign policy and climate change.\nWhere\u2019s the Evolution?\nInsects, birds, mammals, and fish have all been migrating to cooler zones for the past four decades in response to the cataclysmic climate disruption ignited by industrial civilization, but humans are the only organisms inhabiting this blue orb we call Earth who are not altering their behavior.

Detached from nature and enslaved by our own technological creations, we sleepwalk over the cliff of extinction. Our so-called progress will, in the end, disappear like a mirage in the scorching desert sun as nature is sacrificed to the machine of industrial civilization.\nThrowing money into the maw of the \u2018free market\u2019 is the predictable modus operandi of technocapitalism\u2019s indoctrinated disciples who believe such offerings will create a technofix, miraculously healing the planet. In the Star Trek TV series, the Ferengi were an extraterrestrial race whose culture was characterized by \u201ca mercantile obsession with profit and trade, and their constant efforts to swindle unwary customers into unfair deals.\u201d Just like the Ferengi species where profit is the first, last and only important factor, the high temples of private enterprise are commodifying and monetizing the atmosphere just as they have everything else in nature.

We ignore unfolding geologic forces and instead put our faith in manmade market forces to our detriment.\n\u2026The fundamental dilemma all nuclear weapons states face is that to maintain a credible nuclear force, be it a force of one or one thousand nuclear warheads on deployment, a massive military industrial complex must be maintained. As well as building the actual nuclear weapon systems, it must also provide the conventional defence screen consisting of fighter jets, patrols planes, anti-submarine warfare technology etc. In an ultimate irony, the purpose of these becomes to defend the nuclear forces to ensure a second strike can be launched rather than to defend people, because there is no defence against a determined nuclear attack. The military industrial complex that delivers this equipment must be continually fed with new streams of contracts at increasing values otherwise the industrial complex collapses. Thus a key objective in the initial gate document which justified to parliament the early procurement of material for Trident was that, \u201cWe must retain the capability to design, build and support nuclear submarines and meet the commitment for a successor to the Vanguard Class submarines.\u201d In other words, we build Tridents to continue building Tridents.\nThe enormous cost of this needs to be covered by taxes, and for this some \u00a3500 billion of additional excess economic activity is needed which requires energy from fossil fuels and is the antithesis of making the urgent cut backs we need to tackle the soaring greenhouse gas overburden. Thus once the decision is made to proceed with Trident, it becomes impossible to make the climate change agreements to save the planet. In this context Trident is more dangerous than we ever first thought and it is the ultimate Faustian bargain.\nYour commissioners have also failed to acknowledge in their report that the public spending that will be needed on Trident must be made at the same times as scarce public funds must be diverted to building a low carbon economy and mitigating the effects of climate change such as flooding and storm damage. This conflict will arise as tax receipts simultaneously drop through energy price rises.\n\u2026to build at huge expense a nuclear force whilst the nation is effectively bankrupt that will never provide secure protection from nuclear attack and merely encourage our competitors to reciprocate. It drives a race to the bottom where rational decisions on climate change can never be taken.\n\u2026Electricity usage by the military, which accounts for even more greenhouse gas emissions, is also gargantuan. In FY 2006, the DoD used almost 30,000 gigawatt hours of electricity at a cost of almost $2.2 billion. The DoD\u2019s electricity use would supply enough electricity to power more than 2.6 million average American homes.\n\u2026The increased propensity for war and conflict brought about by global warming is being exploited by the military-industrial complex which is planning on how to profit from it. Defense contractors are looking at climate change as a growth and profit opportunity due to the potential conflicts produced by food and water shortages. They are salivating over the potential profits to be made leading to increased stock market performance and, therefore, higher CEO compensation.\nYes, where is the evolution? Teeming within the capitalist industrial civilization that is M.A.D. are 7+ billion naked apes, the most dangerous creature to ever walk the face of the Earth capable of wiping itself out within mere minutes from thermonuclear war, if anthropogenic climate disruption, ocean acidification, and global nuclear reactor meltdowns don\u2019t do the trick.\nFor a glimpse into the life of someone who is actually doing the dangerous and solitary work of true investigative reporting, exposing the dark underbelly of Western imperialism and global capitalism, please read the recent blog post of Andre Vltchek and support his work.\nAndre Vltchek. D.R.\nIt is late at night and you cannot sleep. Ebrie Lagoon is right behind the window of your hotel, but it is hardly visible at this hour. You are in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, West Africa.\nOne of the most costly, self-inflicted wounds engineered by techno-capitalist man is the never-ending Fukushima nuclear disaster. The groundwork for epic failure at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant began in the 1960\u2019s when TEPCO bulldozed 25 meters off of a 35-meter-high hill in order to facilitate the delivery and set up of the plant\u2019s large equipment, which was delivered by boat, as well as to provide easier and cheaper access to seawater used as a coolant pumped through the reactors. TEPCO then dug even further downward another 14 feet to construct the basement where emergency diesel generators would be installed. Decades later a tsunami would easily flood this area, knocking out the emergency electrical back-up generator and making nuclear meltdown a certainty.\nThe last line of defense in preventing the ionizing alpha, beta and gamma radiation and radioisotopes inside melting fuel rods from spewing out into the environment is the containment vessel. The poor design of the now ruptured Mark 1 containment vessel in Fukushima is most certainly contributing to the ongoing disaster there. The U.S. apparently has 23 reactors just like the ones that melted down in Fukushima as well as the risky storage of spent fuel rods next to the reactor building itself.\nWhen the T\u014dhoku tsunami struck at Fukushima, reports describe chaos and incompetency as workers had to bring protective gear and manuals from distant buildings as well as borrow equipment from contractors. The failure of the Japanese government and TEPCO to imagine such a catastrophic event and guard against it is highlighted by the fact that this exact scenario was predicted in a Japanese magna comic book.\n\u2026When officials from the nuclear safety agency or the ministry came to the plant for inspections, they were entertained with drinks the night before. Then they would inspect the plant and give it a hundred per cent pass mark. Then on the way home the inspectors were given beer and snacks and taxi vouchers.\nTokyo has been able to essentially buy the support, or at least the silent acquiescence, of communities by showering them with generous subsidies, payouts and jobs. In 2009 alone, Tokyo gave $1.15 billion for public works projects to communities that have electric plants, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Experts say the majority of that money goes to communities near nuclear plants.\nAnd that is just the tip of the iceberg, experts say, as the communities also receive a host of subsidies, property and income tax revenues, compensation to individuals and even \u201canonymous\u201d donations to local treasuries that are widely believed to come from plant operators.\nUnquestionably, the aid has enriched rural communities that were rapidly losing jobs and people to the cities. With no substantial reserves of oil or coal, Japan relies on nuclear power for the energy needed to drive its economic machine. But critics contend that the largess has also made communities dependent on central government spending \u2014 and thus unwilling to rock the boat by pushing for robust safety measures.\n\u2026Japan\u2019s power-supply industry, collectively, is Japan\u2019s biggest advertiser, spending \u00a588 billion (more than $1 billion) a year, according to the Nikkei Advertising Research Institute. Tepco\u2019s \u00a524.4 billion alone is roughly half what a global firm as large as Toyota spends in a year.\nMembers of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan since 1955 except for a year in the 1990s and for a three-year period ending in 2012, have been rewarded for their pro-nuclear stance with campaign donations from the ten giant electrical utilities that control around 96 percent of the nation\u2019s power supply.\nThe largest of these, the Tokyo Electric Power Company or Tepco, formally ended its direct corporate donations in 1974. But it systematically encouraged \u201cvoluntary\u201d donations by company executives and managers to a fund-raising entity created by the ruling party, according to a 2011 investigation by Asahi. At least 448 Tepco executives donated roughly $777,000 in total to the entity between 1995 and 2009, according to documents obtained by Asahi and shared with the Center.\nTepco\u2019s influence has also been enhanced by its enthusiastic participation in revolving door-employment practices similar to those involving bureaucrats and companies in Washington, D.C.\nPerhaps the most significant instance of ama-agari was the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s appointment in 1998 of Tokio Kano, a longtime Tepco executive, as chairman of the parliamentary committee that oversees METI and as the parliamentary secretary of science and technology. Both are posts crucial to the nuclear energy industry, and Kano used them to advance legislation enabling plutonium-based fuel to be burned in some standard reactors \u2014 not just breeders. He also pushed through a law requiring that all spent nuclear fuel be sent to Rokkasho or similar Japanese plants.\n\u2026The list included people with power in the opposition parties, such as the former prime minister Naoto Kan and the politician Ishiro Ozawa, and I was told that my name, Mako Oshidori, was listed alongside these names. A researcher who was given the list and told not to approach anybody on it was friendly with me and told me the list included my name. Soon after that a mysterious man began to follow me. This man appeared to be a member of Public Security Intelligence Agency in the Cabinet Office, which investigates various things. One of my hobbies is taking a candid shot, and I will show you the successful candid shot of this man.\nExports of nuclear components and technology, as well as conventional arms, are potentially key elements of \u201cAbenomics\u201d and much is riding on the outcome. In 2013, Abe concluded Japan\u2019s first nuclear reactor export agreement with Turkey for $22 billion and others are pending with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, while the prime minister has also lobbied governments in Central Europe, Vietnam and Indonesia. This is a remarkable turnaround from 2011 when the prospects for post-Fukushima Japan relying on nuclear energy, let alone exporting it, looked unlikely.\nThe seeds for Japan\u2019s nuclear hara-kiri were planted back in the early 1950\u2019s when the American government hatched a propaganda campaign of developing an \u201catoms for peace\u201d mission in Japan to foster pro-nuclear sentiment and help rebuild their economy using such technology.\nThe US-Japan Security Treaty of 1960 stipulates that an attack on Japan will be regarded as an attack on the United States. Prime Minister Abe is seeking to transform Japan\u2019s constitution to permit engagement of the Japanese armed forces in aggressive wars. But it is difficult to imagine a resurgent military posture by Japan without tacit encouragement from Washington.\nThe highest stage of monopoly capitalism is fascism. The 2008 global economic crisis of capitalism, still unresolved, is forcing ill-advised and counterproductive \u201causterity measures\u201d on decaying capitalist societies throughout Europe and in Japan, where Prime Minister Abe is restructuring the economy into the very pro-market system which is producing riots throughout Western Europe, as living standards deteriorate drastically, and the income inequality gap becomes an abyss.\nSome ask why Hiroshima and Nagasaki were rebuilt and repopulated so soon after a nuclear bomb blast, yet Fukushima and Chernobyl remain unsafe to inhabit into the indefinite future. The answer lies in the vast difference of irradiating potential between a nuclear bomb and a nuclear reactor.\nThe nuclear bombs used in World War II were detonated roughly 2,000 feet above ground and their radioisotopes were carried by the wind and dispersed over a very large area. The nuclear bomb called \u201cLittle Boy\u201d used over Hiroshima contained only 140 pounds of fissionable material (Uranium-235) and \u201cFat Man\u201d used over Nagasaki contained just 14 pounds of Plutonium-239. These are minute amounts of radioisotopes when compared to the 180 tons of nuclear fuel at Chernobyl and the staggering 1,600 tons at Fukushima. Explosions and meltdowns at nuclear reactors occur at ground level, creating more radioactive isotopes due to neutron activation with the soils while spreading their radiation across the planet, year after year after year. Today the background radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is said to be the same as the global average anywhere on Earth. Ground zero at Chernobyl and Fukushima won\u2019t be habitable for 20,000 years or longer. Nuclear bombs kill hundreds of thousands of people instantly while a nuclear reactor meltdown kills people over years, decades, and generations.\nThe too-big-to-fail TEPCO is now building the Great Ice Wall of Japan to stem the flow of tons of contaminated water that they have been hastily storing in hundreds of haphazardly constructed containers.\nNuclear plants were originally given a license to operate for 40 years, and in the late 1990s, the NRC began accepting applications to extend those licenses for an additional 20 years. While it\u2019s not clear how many current plants will still be operating in 2100, most facilities store their nuclear waste on-site, where it can continue to emit radiation for thousands of years. There is currently no long-term national storage site for spent nuclear fuel in the U.S., as Congress cut the funding to build such a facility at Nevada\u2019s Yucca Mountain in 2011. While there are no near-term plans to remove nuclear waste from the coastal plants threatened by rising seas, \u201cthe expectation is that [waste] won\u2019t remain on-site,\u201d said NRC Senior Public Affairs Officer Roger Hannah.\nDespite the increased risk of flooding due to rising sea levels, some plant operators have not factored this into their long-term plans. In 2010, when Florida Power and Light Company applied for a license to build two additional reactors at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station in Homestead, Florida, the NRC asked the plant\u2019s owners to explain \u201chow potential sea-level rise due to potential future climate change is accounted for\u201d in their plans, NRC documents show. The company declined to discuss climate change in its analysis, and used a projection that assumed a constant sea level rise of just 1 foot per century, which is 5.6 feet lower than NOAA\u2019s worst-case projection for 2100.\nThe risks to the ocean, in particular, are unprecedented because there is good reason to believe that melted fuel residing in, or below, the reactor basements is in direct contact with an underground river running through the site (Nagata, 2013).\nA German study modelling the effects of an uncontained core meltdown suggests the Pacific Ocean is imperiled. The \u201cGerman Risk Study, Phase B\u201d found that a core meltdown accident could result in complete failures of all structural containment, causing melted fuel to exit the reactor foundation within five days (cited in Bayer, Tromm, & Al-Omari 1989). Moreover, the study found that even in the event of an intact building foundation, passing groundwater would be in direct contact with fuel, causing leaching of fission products. Strontium leaches slower than cesium. A follow-up German study, \u201cDispersion of Radionuclides and Radiation Exposure after Leaching by Groundwater of a Solidified Core-Concrete Melt,\u201d predicted that strontium contamination levels would rise exponentially years after a full melt-through located adjacent to a river (Bayer, Tromm, & Al-Omari, 1989).\nThe study predicted concentrations of Strontium-90 in river water would spike relatively suddenly, but maintain extraordinarily high levels of contamination for years. Strontium bio-accumulates in the human body, including the brain, and is a known genotoxin. The study\u2019s experimental conditions are roughly similar to Daiichi\u2019s site conditions and strontium levels have been spiking there since the summer of 2013. TEPCO just reported that strontium levels in reactor basement water ranged from 40 million to 500 million becquerels per liter (\u201cTEPCO to Improve,\u201d 2014).\n\nWrite a haiku: to those who to \u201cto to the to the to be to the \u201cto these to 2020 to the world to the \u2018To the \u201cThe \u201cto this to be to the to \u201cTo \u201cto that to the to be to the 30\u2019s \u201cto \u201cIn the to their to \u201cto \u201cit to a \u201cto the \u201cto be to \u201cfused to \u201cto \u201cthe \u201cto the to \u201call to the to \u201cTo to and \u201ca to make of to a \u201cIn to those to the to \u201cto be, to \u201cbe to be \u201cTo those, but to the \u201cA is to people to be.

Since launching her eponymous label in 2014, the London-based designer has dressed celebrities ranging from Rihanna and Agyness Deyn to Adwoa Aboah and Killing Eve\u2019s Villanelle (Jodie Comer).\nShe\u2019s also won high-profile accolades, including the British Emerging Talent Award at the 2016 Fashion Awards, Breakthrough Designer at the Harper\u2019s Bazaar 2017 Women of the Year Awards, and the 2018 BFC/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund. In 2019 she was awarded a BFC Fashion Trust grant. Now, she has her own outlet at Dover Street Market in London and is represented in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute in New York and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\nIn June, selected looks from Goddard\u2019s archive collections \u2014 including her Autumn/Winter 2019 Ready-to-Wear collection, inspired by Thomas Hardy\u2019s Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles \u2014 will be shown in The Art of Literature: Auction Highlights (6-15 June), part of London Now, at Christie\u2019s in King Street.\nCurated by specialists Victoria Gramm (Post-War and Contemporary Art), Mark Wiltshire (Books and Manuscripts), and client advisor Annabelle Scholar, the exhibition explores the connections between art and literature over the centuries through a selection of lots from across Christie\u2019s summer season of auctions.\nHighlights include Alfred Stevens\u2019s Oph\u00e9lie (Ophelia), above, one of a series of works depicting Shakespeare\u2019s tragic character painted by the Belgian artist between 1886 and 1891; and Fernand Khnopff\u2019s atypical portrait of Medusa, showing her asleep, with the body of an eagle and a woman\u2019s head (below).\nAlso on display will be Rodin\u2019s Thinker, originally conceived in 1880 as part of La Porte de l\u2019Enfer, the artist\u2019s monumental gateway representing Dante\u2019s Inferno. At first, Rodin intended the ruminating man to be an image of Dante contemplating his own work, but he then opted to divest the sculpture of any explicit reference. The result is a timeless and universal symbol of reflection and creative genius.\nGoddard has made her name creating fantastical dresses in brightly coloured tulle, taffeta, organdie and silk that are as happily paired with loafers and chunky knits as they are with stilettos and glittering jewels. Though layered and voluminous, they are lightweight and anything but rigid.\nBut it isn\u2019t all about playing dress up \u2014 Goddard is deeply concerned with the art of construction: hand-craft techniques such as smocking, shirring, tatting and crocheting are essential to her aesthetic.\nWith London Fashion Week looming, and nothing to show from her course, she decided to create a portfolio of sorts, with the aim of landing a job.\nThe off-schedule presentation in September 2014 was an unexpected hit, drawing influential fashion press, as well as brands and buyers. Since then she has become a regular fixture at London Fashion Week, collaborated with retailers on sell-out collections, and expanded her range of products to include menswear, bags and bridal.\nWhich brings us back to her 2019 Ready-to-Wear collection.\nThe six dresses coming to Christie\u2019s will be suspended from the ceiling rather than displayed on models or mannequins.\nLook 10 (above) is a case in point.

The second is the contemporary style, which uses a syllable structure that\u2019s much easier to follow.\n\nA typical haiku poem is written in one long poem. A lot of the words are in a single line and the last line is made up of one of the three sentences. Some haiku poems are longer than others. Usually, they are around six lines long.

Scroll Down..\nSituated in northern Tanzania in between Arusha and Moshi township is the little-known treasure of Arusha National Park. Covering approximately 552 sq. km (212 sq. miles), the park features a variety of ecosystems, such as grasslands, swamps, crater lakes, highland forest and much more, and the three largest landmarks in the park are Momela Lakes, Mount Meru and Ngurdoto Crater. As you travel through the Arusha wilderness during your exploratory tour, you may find yourself winding along a road that is shaded by a canopy of trees overhead.  In the distance, you may see the majestic Kilimanjaro but an up, close and personal view of the rugged Meru mountain. The other prominent features of the park are Ngongongare Springs, Lokie Swamp, Senato Pools, Lake Jembamba and Lake Longil. Some of the small pools are dry until the rains, at which time you may see waterfowl, as well as other animals coming to drink. Grazing herbivores are frequently seen at Lake Longil and the rich grasses make it a lovely place for a picnic. As you relax, you may even spot a fish eagle diving for Tilapia fish. The high forests of the mountains are home to black and white colobus, and on the open plains, you may see zebra, giraffe, warthog, bushbuck and other herbivores. These prey animals attract limited predators, and your guide may be able to help you spot these stealthy carnivores though the park is not predator concentrated.\nWith over 400 species of winged fauna, Arusha National Park is a bird lovers destination. High above you may see Augur Buzzard, African Crowned, Tawny and Snake Eagles, and both the forest trees and lakes are favored residences for pelicans, bee-eaters, flamingos hornbills, herons, ducks, waders and many others. Discover this and much more during your wildlife safari of this expanse of Africa with a game drive or canoe excursion. Game drives cover the greatest distances and allow you to observe the largest variety of wildlife and animal behavior. These unbelievable daily excursions show you the diversity of Arusha National Park, all while you travel in the comfort of a safari vehicle.

I will try working with less cores, but I can't change the RAM since the application I am working with has a minimum memory requirement of 8 GB. so if I set it to use only 2 gb ram I can't work either...\nre. not being able to reduce the RAM. That basically puts you between a rock and a hard place.\nre. the 2 CPU's. Your main issue is the RAM problem as evidenced by the slow reads in your log file. Sorry for distracting you on that one. I would still change it, but you've got bigger fish to fry before that even comes into play.\nTriggers after 2GB of modified data is cached, regardless of file. Once triggered, it stays triggered as long as the file is open.\nYour VM has 9GB of RAM and the VM's RAM is backed by a file. So perhaps the issue can be mitigated a bit by turning off that feature, but I'm only stabbing in the dark here.\nI think it would be best to open a support case with VMware and see if they can help you on a user case bases.\nThanks for your input. Well, I did now reduce the numbers of CPU down to 2 and reduced the vm's RAM down to 5. This makes the application I am using difficult in handling but, at least so far, I have not experienced any stalls no more. Although I am still getting errors in the log as shown below. As long as it doesn't unexpectedly hang as before, this is some improvement for me. Still it's not a real solution for me, but for the time being until there is a fix from Vmware I am trying to work like this.\nbut at least the timeout issue seems to have disappeared, which seem to have caused the stalls.\nMany thanks again for your continuous support!\nI switched the vmem file off and reverted to RAM plus swap for the VM. It seems to make a significant difference and I am running VMs now without any particular issues on MacBook Pro 15\" 2018 model with 16GB RAM.\nmainmem.useNamedFile = \"FALSE\"\nI would be interested in if this makes a difference for you.\nI did enter the two above lines into the .vmx config file. I upped the RAM to 6 GB and after a while I got again errors and stalls.\nthere was neither a config directory nor a config file.\nbut anyway, still getting errors and hangs.\nare you running 10.14.6?\nnow I am back at 4GB RAM, which is really the least I can set, since the app I am working with is not working otherwise....\ncould anyone please explain, WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON AND WHY THIS IS HAPPENING?\nI am getting choleric more and more everyday, since this is not a way to work.\nI start asking myself why I the world, did I buy a Vmware license for...

But at the end of the day, people have to understand that even though we're his family, he's thinking about his immediate family.\"\nOne of Schiano's recruits from Florida, Bing felt that the Rutgers coach was looking for a new challenge in his coaching career.\n\"Maybe he just needed a new challenge,\" Bing said. \"He was always a guy that was meeting new challenges every day and breaking barriers \u2014 and you've got to respect a guy for that. He's had the opportunity to coach in the NFL before, but not at this level \u2014 being a head coach.\"\nTwo Rutgers alums also featured prominently in last weekend's conference championship round of the playoffs. Anthony Davis, the No. 11 overall pick in the 2010 draft, started at right tackle for the San Francisco 49ers. Ray Rice, a former All-America selection at Rutgers, started at running back for the Baltimore Ravens.\nMohamed Sanu, the Rutgers wide receiver who set a Big East record for receptions in a season, is expected to be a first or second round draft choice this year.\n\"Just think about this: The amount of respect and the level of power that he had at Rutgers,\" Bing said. \"So you have to understand, it wasn't about that. And I respect that. Sometimes you want more than power and money.\"\nWrite a haiku: A\nNew challenge sought\nBy Schiano, now we know\nGiants lose in Super Bowl", "completion_only": "A\nNew challenge sought\nBy Schiano, now we know\nGiants lose in Super Bowl", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 49, "avg_token_entropy": 2.3468858542896465, "avg_token_perplexity": 15.601549184118673, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

The last two lines of the sonnet constitute a couplet, and should be treated as a final statement in which some resolution or conclusion is attempted.\nRead the news at http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr\nLog in to Twitter or Facebook account to connect\nwith the Korea JoongAng Daily\nhelp-image Social comment?\nlock icon\n\n\nStandards Board Policy (0/250\uc790)\n\nWhat\u2019s Popular Now", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 55, "avg_token_entropy": 1.2844839358513949, "avg_token_perplexity": 6.302576679082638, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}

For example, we have enabled to visualize lipid headgroups, \u03b2-sheets and \u03b1-helices of proteins with subnanometer resolution. We are also interested in the imaging of 3D force distribution at interfaces between a biological system and physiological solution.

However, the use of FM-AFM in liquid was very limited due to the poor performance compared to that in vacuum. In 2004, I have presented a way to overcome this limitation and succeeded in atomic-resolution imaging by FM-AFM in liquid for the first time.

In this way, we believe our research should indirectly but widely have an impact on our daily life.\nWhich parts of the typical AFM stop working in liquids and need to be customized?\n\u4e1c\u6210\u897f\u5c31ill\u5fc5\u4e2d\u2467\u7801For me, the most important part is the cantilever deflection sensor. The performance of a liquid-environment AFM is often limited by the noise from the cantilever deflection sensor as well as the low Q factor of the cantilever resonance.

We should note that the noise from an OBD sensor in liquid can be significantly larger than that in air.\nWhat are the strategies to cope the low Q factor of cantilevers in liquids?\nTo be honest, I have never been able to overcome the theoretical limit determined by the Q factor. Instead, my strategy was to develop an instrument that can achieve the optimal performance limited only by the Q factor. First, I use a relatively stiff cantilever (spring constant > 10 N/m) to suppress the thermal vibration of a cantilever. Secondly, I use small oscillation amplitude (< 0.5 nm) to enhance the sensitivity to a short range interaction force. Finally, I use a low noise cantilever deflection sensor (floor noise < 20 fm/rtHz) to achieve the optimal performance limited only by the Q factor.

So, my colleagues did very well in training me to drink a beer at a pub.\nThere was a time when lock-in amplifiers were bulky pieces of equipment, weighing 10 to 20 kilograms or more, and lots of buttons jammed on the front panel. In some models, manufacturers reduced the number of buttons by implementing hierarchical menus. The effect was that the user had to press buttons more often to change even the simplest setting.

For instance, each Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier is delivered with an oscilloscope, a frequency response sweeper and a spectroscope. Regular software updates bring new features that also support more applications.\nToday, Zurich Instruments is upgrading all our lock-in amplifiers in the field with a high performance FFT spectrum analyzer. Convenient spectrum analysis is displayed in real-time on the computer screen. While the bandwidth of the displayed spectrum can be adjusted logarithmically by factors of 2 from 1.75 Hz up to 230 kHz, the FFT also has an extremely high resolution with up to 32\u2019000 lines per spectrum. Such high line resolutions are made possible by the combination of the lock-in amplifier for data reduction with the subsequent FFT.

The new feature is called Sinc filtering, and permits to completely remove the omega and 2 omega components in the measurement result. These omega components are the result of the demodulation and can disturb the measurement result considerably at low frequencies. The Sinc filter completely removes the unwanted components with a notch filter, with an attenuation that is better than 80 dB. Zurich Instruments supports Sinc filtering up to 10 kHz frequency range, which is a factor of at least 10 better than competing instruments.\nFree of charge, Zurich Instruments is upgrading all our customers\u2019 HF2LI lock-in amplifiers with the new software release 11.02 (additional release details are provided below in 11.02 software release).\n\u4e1c\u6210\u897f\u5c31ill\u5fc5\u4e2d\u2467\u7801In addition to the FFT spectrum analyzer and Sinc filtering, the new 11.02 software release provides several other improvements.

These new techniques are likely to become very important in the field of biochemical microscopy, as complements to fluorescence imaging techniques and MRI which currently are widely used to capture images of organs. A high performance lock-in amplifier is a key element in these new measurement techniques.\nRaman spectroscopy can be used to identify molecules based on the vibrational frequencies of chemical bonds excited by a laser. Among others, there are two very promising technologies which have recently been developed, \u201cCoherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering\u201d (CARS) and \u201cStimulated Raman Scattering\u201d (SRS). Both are non-linear Raman techniques in which vibrational states of molecules are excited by synchronized laser pulses of different wavelengths. The resulting optical signal which is emitted from the tissue can be used to identify molecular bonds and thereby reconstruct images of living tissue. The lasers can be focused on one point, much like in two-photon microscopy, which allows for 2D and also 3D imaging. For monitoring fast phenomena, so-called video-rate CARS/SRS is used. This technique allows for the monitoring of transients, as for example in the diffusion of an injected drug in tissue.\nThe lock-in amplifier plays an important role for both CARS and SRS. Both of these imaging techniques suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio, as lasers have a large amount of noise, especially at low frequencies. In order to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, laser modulation techniques and subsequent narrow-band filtering using a lock-in amplifier are applied. The requirements for fast imaging and efficient noise suppression make the high performance HF2LI lock-in amplifier a good solution. The HF2LI results in sharp CARS and SRS imaging for several reasons: sophisticated digital filtering (with steep roll-off filters) leads to a very high dynamic reserve of 120 dB (100 times better than the 80 dB of older, analog lock-in amplifiers) and efficient noise suppression. Furthermore, the HF2LI minimum time-constant of 780 ns allows for video-rate CARS and SRS with sharper images. Low jitter in the HF2LI output signals further improves image contrast.\nPhase sensitive detection, both in lock-ins and impedance spectroscopy, is a fundamental technique to extract weak signals from large background noise, and the filter setting is one of the most important parameters. Generally, one uses a large bandwidth (small time-constant) to observe fast transient signals. But, larger bandwidth also means more noise: the amount of noise power in the demodulated signal increases proportionally to the filter bandwidth. Using a small bandwidth (big time-constant) reduces the amount of noise in the output, but only slow or static signals can be observed.\nThe empirical approach to set the correct filter bandwidths is to measure several traces of the same physical quantity with different filter settings: the filters in each measurement should be 3-10 times larger than in the previous one. While doing this, the user should make sure that the sampling rate is about 10 times the filter bandwidth. The correct filter setting is achieved when the signal of interest is not smoothed by the reduced filter bandwidth, and increasing the bandwidth does not reveal any additional information about the signal dynamics but only lets through a larger amount of noise.\n\u4e1c\u6210\u897f\u5c31ill\u5fc5\u4e2d\u2467\u7801In the next newsletter (Edition Q3/2011), we will address the related question of how to set the sampling rate in a lock-in amplifier.

Zurich Instruments supports Sinc filtering up to 10 kHz frequency range, which is a factor of at least 10 better than competing instruments.\nFree of charge, Zurich Instruments is upgrading all our customers\u2019 HF2LI lock-in amplifiers with the new software release 11.02 (additional release details are provided below in 11.02 software release).\n\u4e1c\u6210\u897f\u5c31ill\u5fc5\u4e2d\u2467\u7801In addition to the FFT spectrum analyzer and Sinc filtering, the new 11.02 software release provides several other improvements. For instance the frequency response sweeper has several new features, the graphical user interface supports the new HF2LI-PID option, and the transfer speed of the USB interface has been increased by 50%. Furthermore, square-wave signal generation has been added, and programmers will enjoy a series of new functions, as well as official support for MATLAB and Python 2.6.\nAll users of the HF2IS Impedance Spectroscope, HF2LI Lock-in Amplifier, and HF2PLL Phase-locked Loop are warmly recommended to switch to the new 11.02 software release. For support and access credentials to the download area from Zurich Instruments, do not hesitate to contact |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| Recent measurement techniques based on Raman spectroscopy enable 3D imaging of unlabelled molecular species. These new techniques are likely to become very important in the field of biochemical microscopy, as complements to fluorescence imaging techniques and MRI which currently are widely used to capture images of organs. A high performance lock-in amplifier is a key element in these new measurement techniques.\nRaman spectroscopy can be used to identify molecules based on the vibrational frequencies of chemical bonds excited by a laser. Among others, there are two very promising technologies which have recently been developed, \u201cCoherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering\u201d (CARS) and \u201cStimulated Raman Scattering\u201d (SRS). Both are non-linear Raman techniques in which vibrational states of molecules are excited by synchronized laser pulses of different wavelengths. The resulting optical signal which is emitted from the tissue can be used to identify molecular bonds and thereby reconstruct images of living tissue. The lasers can be focused on one point, much like in two-photon microscopy, which allows for 2D and also 3D imaging. For monitoring fast phenomena, so-called video-rate CARS/SRS is used. This technique allows for the monitoring of transients, as for example in the diffusion of an injected drug in tissue.\nThe lock-in amplifier plays an important role for both CARS and SRS. Both of these imaging techniques suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio, as lasers have a large amount of noise, especially at low frequencies. In order to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, laser modulation techniques and subsequent narrow-band filtering using a lock-in amplifier are applied. The requirements for fast imaging and efficient noise suppression make the high performance HF2LI lock-in amplifier a good solution. The HF2LI results in sharp CARS and SRS imaging for several reasons: sophisticated digital filtering (with steep roll-off filters) leads to a very high dynamic reserve of 120 dB (100 times better than the 80 dB of older, analog lock-in amplifiers) and efficient noise suppression. Furthermore, the HF2LI minimum time-constant of 780 ns allows for video-rate CARS and SRS with sharper images. Low jitter in the HF2LI output signals further improves image contrast.\nPhase sensitive detection, both in lock-ins and impedance spectroscopy, is a fundamental technique to extract weak signals from large background noise, and the filter setting is one of the most important parameters. Generally, one uses a large bandwidth (small time-constant) to observe fast transient signals. But, larger bandwidth also means more noise: the amount of noise power in the demodulated signal increases proportionally to the filter bandwidth. Using a small bandwidth (big time-constant) reduces the amount of noise in the output, but only slow or static signals can be observed.\nThe empirical approach to set the correct filter bandwidths is to measure several traces of the same physical quantity with different filter settings: the filters in each measurement should be 3-10 times larger than in the previous one. While doing this, the user should make sure that the sampling rate is about 10 times the filter bandwidth. The correct filter setting is achieved when the signal of interest is not smoothed by the reduced filter bandwidth, and increasing the bandwidth does not reveal any additional information about the signal dynamics but only lets through a larger amount of noise.\n\u4e1c\u6210\u897f\u5c31ill\u5fc5\u4e2d\u2467\u7801In the next newsletter (Edition Q3/2011), we will address the related question of how to set the sampling rate in a lock-in amplifier. Stay tuned.\n\nWrite a haiku: In the haiku form, one may express the essence of an event or place with an economical use of words (5-7-5 syllables), so that the essence of the observation comes through in a simple way, with no excess verbiage. The first step is to identify what is essential to the observation, and then write it in a few words. Next, find an image for it which is also concise. (A metaphor or simile may help.) Finally, find an appropriate tone for it - is it a happy or sad place, should the reader feel good or bad, and so on.\nWrite an epic: An epic poem (or \u201cepic\u201d) is a long story, usually told in verse. Such poems can be set in the present day, but typically cover a significant stretch of time. An epic usually presents the heroic deeds of a central character. They often cover themes of fate and mortality, and may have religious significance.\n\u4e1c\u6210\u897f\u5c31ill\u5fc5\u4e2d\u2467\u7801An epic typically features a central character of great strength and endurance, who struggles in the face of impossible odds and overcomes them. This character may be a king, a priest, an adventurer, or even a god. The protagonist is often aided by an advisor, or mentor character, who guides them in choosing the proper course. Other characters may play the role of antagonist, or even a force of nature itself. All these characters are drawn with great detail, each having their own motivations and goals.\nThe plot of an epic can be a straightforward narrative of the protagonist\u2019s actions, from birth to death. Or it can start in medias res, picking up the story somewhere in the middle. In this case, the audience will be able to fill in the background with what they already know of the culture the work is set in. (For example, the Iliad begins at a pivotal moment in the Trojan War, which the audience can already picture thanks to the works of earlier poets.) The poet may even drop in the occasional aside, which comments on the action or provides some context. The poet may also allude to a work of the past or make a direct reference to it.\n\u4e1c\u6210\u897f\u5c31ill\u5fc5\u4e2d\u2467\u7801The audience should have some familiarity with the world and culture the epic takes place in, so that the poet does not have to explain every detail. This gives the audience more time to focus on the action itself, rather than the background.

Southern has played just one other home playoff game in its history, which it did in 2011.\n\"We knew it would be tough considering it was their Senior Night and they were playing for a playoff spot,\" Robinson said. \nSouthern was its most potent at the beginning of each half, scoring on each of its first two drives of the game and again to open the third quarter. Robinson had a hand in all three scoring plays and the first was the longest play of the game.\nOn 3rd-and-7 from his team's own 41 yard line, Robinson took the shotgun snap, hung in the pocket and unleashed a 59-yard bomb over the middle to junior wide receiver Xavier Hendricks, who pulled in the pass and outran the last defender to the end zone.\n\"Jaiden has been doing a great job all year long so we knew they would probably stack the box against us to try to stop him,\" Robinson said. \"When we got a chance, we wanted to take advantage by throwing the ball and that's what we did.\"\nSouthern quickly got the ball back after a Central three-and-out and moved from its own 42 to Central's 22 with a mix of runs by Brown and senior Will DeVane - the latter of whom kicked off the drive with a 17-yard sweep.\nOnce again, Robinson came through on third down, this time calling his own number on 3rd-and-5 and scampering down the middle of the field for a 22-yard score. With the extra point by Hank Gallacher, Southern led 14-0 with 1:41 left in the first quarter.\nRobinson finished 3-for-6 for 109 yards through the air and on the one interception he threw, the senior raced down the field to make the tackle just nine yards after sophomore Danny Morris picked it off.\n\"He made some good throws today and he is going to have to make more of those,\" Southern coach Chuck Donohue Sr. said. \"When you get to the playoffs, you have to be able to make plays in the passing game and he has shown he is capable of making plays down the field like he did today.\"\nAfter Central cut the deficit to 14-9 by halftime, Southern reasserted control to open the half by driving 72 yards on 10 plays to once again reach the end zone on a third-down touchdown run by Robinson - this time on a one-yard plunge. The key play on the drive was a 54-yard touchdown burst by Brown on 2nd-and-15 to move the ball from the Rams 23 to the Golden Eagles 23.\nEach time Southern came out strong, Central adjusted and quieted the Rams offense for the remainder of the half to give itself a chance to rally.\nOn the first play of the second quarter, senior Gunnar Nemeth tracked down Robinson in the end zone for a sack and a safety to get Central on the board at 14-2. The ensuing kickoff gave the Golden Eagles the ball at midfield and at that point, the home team road its own horse out of the backfield.\nSenior Landon Richardson carried the ball nine straight times, capping the drive with a one-yard touchdown burst to cut Southern's lead to 14-9 after Sean Hurley's extra point. Richardson's longest run of the drive was an 18-yard pickup on 3rd-and-3 to advance the ball to Southern's 13 yard line.\nCentral appeared poised to cut the deficit to one score in the third quarter after senior quarterback Gavin Whelan hit junior Danny Taris for a 36-yard play-action pass down to the Southern 16. On the next play, however, Richardson fumbled the ball and Hendrick's picked it up on the 21 to notch a crucial red zone turnover.\nDespite the momentum-killing fumble, Central forced a three-and-out and got the ball back in Southern territory after a punt. Once again, however, the Golden Eagles could not turn the field position in the points as they turned it over on downs at the 27.\nThe defense delivered another three-and-out and after a botched snap and zero-yard punt by Southern, the third time was the charm for Central. Richardson capped the 35-yard drive with his second one-yard touchdown run to pull the Golden Eagles within 21-16. Whelan completed two passes for the two longest plays of the drive - one a 10-yard connection with sophomore Anthony Musso on the first play and the other a nine-yard completion to junior Mike Prasad to get the ball down to the five yard line.\nRichardson finished the game with 112 yards on 28 carries to lead the Central offense.\nA block-in-the-back penalty on the ensuing kickoff backed Southern up to its own five yard-line but Robinson and Hendricks immediately dug their team out of that hole. Robinson rifled a pass over the middle and Hendricks elevated over a defender to pull in a 40-yard catch that flipped the field position the rest of the way. Central kept Southern off the board but by the time the Golden Eagles got the ball back, it was on their own 23 with 2:21 remaining.\n\"We had a couple of bad snaps with out punt team and we felt that we had to get it away from our end zone,\" Donohue said. \"We felt we had to throw it when we gave up the safety. We took a chance there and it didn't work out but the second time we tried it, it worked out for us.\"\nAfter a false start and an incomplete pass, Whelan had to come off the field when his helmet came off and Central fumbled the snap on the very next play to set up 3rd-and-17. Whelan fired two incomplete passes to give Southern the ball back and effectively end the game.\nCentral's chances to clinch a spot in the Group IV playoffs took a major hit with Friday's loss while a win would have most likely clinched a spot for the Golden Eagles.\n\"I really hope they get in,\" Donohue said of Central. \"They are playing really well later in the season here and I think they are deserving.

These lines contain the following syllables: 5, 7, and 5. The 5 syllables must fit on the first line, the 7 syllables on the second, and the 5 syllables on the last line. A haiku is not a poem about how something is supposed to look, but rather how it seems to look to the author. It is meant to capture a moment and not necessarily tell about the subject itself.

The 5 syllables go on the first line: My cat sleeps so cute, 7 syllables on the second line: His paws are so funny, 5 syllables on the last line: I'm glad he is my kitty! To write a haiku about your cat, simply list three things you know about your cat. Those 3 things will be the 3 lines of your haiku. For example: My cat likes to eat, My cat drinks water, My cat sleeps with me\n\nWrite a haiku: Haiku\n\nA Haiku is a poem that doesn't have to be about anything at all. The only rule is that it has to have exactly 17 syllables and be divided into 3 lines with 5, 7, and 5 syllables for each line. An example of a Haiku is: The grass blows in the wind, White clouds pass by slowly, A robin chirps in the tree.\n\nWrite a haiku: Haiku\n\nA Haiku is a Japanese poem that has 3 lines with 5 syllables in the first line, 7 syllables in the second line, and 5 syllables in the last line.

In February 2002, Arsenal won the FA Cup for the seventh time in their history after a 2\u20131 win over their nearest rivals for the title, Tottenham Hotspur, in the final. The title race went down to the final day of the season for the first time since 1995. Arsenal needed to beat local rivals Southampton and hope that they would win for the first time in the calendar month. Southampton, however, beat Coventry City 3\u20131, leaving Arsenal needing to win their match against Everton to retain the title.

When reviewing these options, be sure to only consider companies that offer what you need. Once you understand the services that your association desires, it is time to search and ask questions.\n#1 What Services Does Each HOA Management Company Offer?\nEach neighborhood is different; therefore each one has specific needs. Similarly, each HOA management company is different. The common services offered include communication, financial, administration, customer service, and maintenance. Some offer more inclusive service packages. It is also imperative to inquire about their level of involvement with the community. Are they a proactive company, ahead of the issues? Or, are they more reactive, responding when there is an issue? Ask specific questions to determine what \u201cfull-service\u201d means and feel free to ask to look over a typical contract for the services you require.

Read more about this and other news.\nAfter excluding God from their platform, Democrats hurriedly rewrote their convention platform Wednesday amid criticism to add a mention of God and declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel, reports news.yahoo.com. The embarrassing reversal was compounded by chaos and uncertainty on the convention floor. Three times Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, the convention chairman, called for a voice vote on the changes and each time the yes and no votes seemed to balance each other out. On the third attempt, Villaraigosa ruled the amendments were approved, triggering boos from many in the audience. The episode exposed tensions on Israel within the party, put Democrats on the defensive, and created a public relations spectacle as Obama arrived in the convention city to claim his party\u2019s nomination for a second term. \u201cThere was no discussion.

Throughout the half-hour broadcast on The Janet Mefferd Show, host Mefferd and Chambers engaged in a debate that at times got testy. \u201cI have to completely disagree with you on this idea that we are just called to love people where they are and not go to somebody who claims to be a brother in Christ, who is absolutely wrong on this issue (of homosexuality), who is obviously not in Christ even though he\u2019s using that name, and use the platform of Exodus International to basically excuse sin which unfortunately, that\u2019s what I think to some extent you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mefferd told Chambers. Chambers, whose ministry helps those who struggle with same-sex attraction, asked if he could go on The Janet Mefferd Show after the radio host voiced her opinion that Chambers is not suited to head Exodus International. Mefferd, a former news and religion reporter, has denounced Chambers\u2019 recent statements that active, unrepentant homosexuals can go to Heaven, among many other remarks. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about homosexuality per se; it\u2019s about the gospel,\u201d she stated on her program Wednesday.\nA church-state watchdog group has filed an amicus brief on behalf of the Washington State Board of Pharmacy in a case where pharmacists refused to supply contraception over religious objections. Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed the brief on Tuesday in the case against Ralph\u2019s Thriftway, whose pharmacy refuses to comply with state rules regarding contraception. \u201cThe Washington State regulatory scheme at issue strikes a careful, appropriate balance between the religious freedom of pharmacists and that of their patients. Individual pharmacists are given the right to decline to fill prescriptions if doing so would be contrary to their personal religious or moral beliefs,\u201d reads the brief. \u201cThe regulatory scheme thus prevents an individual pharmacist\u2019s religious beliefs from being foisted onto a patient who may hold quite different beliefs.\u201d In 2006, the Washington State Board of Pharmacy considered implementing rules mandating all pharmacists in the state to supply emergency contraceptives with exemptions for pharmacists who had religious objections. By 2007, however, the rules did not guarantee exemption for businesses and soon afterwards a suit was brought on behalf of the family-owned Ralph\u2019s pharmacy in Olympia as well as two individual pharmacists. In February, U.S. District Judge Ronald Leighton ruled that the state\u2019s mandate was unconstitutional in that it violated the rights of those who hold religious objections. The suit was then sent to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \u201cThis win is an important battle in the national war for conscience protection,\u201d said Eric Rassbach, then-deputy general counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, in an earlier interview with The Christian Post.\nAn attorney says officials at a Pennsylvania Christian school were right to fire a teacher for disagreeing with the school\u2019s policy on homosexuality, though she claims it was because of her alleged mental disability, reports onenewsnow.com. Susan Wright filed suit against Covenant Christian Academy for allegedly terminating her because of the mental health problems brought on after her son announced he was gay. But David Cortman of the Alliance Defending Freedom explains that her emotional stress was not related to her dismissal.  \u201cSo, I certainly believe it\u2019s two separate issues here.\u201d He points out that numerous court decisions support the right of religious organizations to carry out their religious faith and mission. \u201cReligious organizations have to have the right to put forth the religious message that they see fit,\u201d Cortman contends. \u201cCertainly she doesn\u2019t have to agree with that message, but nor does she have the right to teach there if she doesn\u2019t.\u201d The ADF attorney thinks the court should grant the motion to dismiss the case, because the school did not violate the Americans with Disabilities Act, as Wright claims.\nThe national debate over gay marriage will center this fall on the Democratic and Republican platforms and in the presidential race, but another, more localized battle over legal recognition of homosexuality is playing out in city halls and town squares in the American heartland, often with pro-family forces trying to reverse decisions by government officials, reports Baptist Press. In Springfield, Mo., the city council was scheduled to vote in late August on whether to prohibit discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations based on sexual orientation and gender identity or put the proposal to a public vote. Instead, after weeks of passionate debate, the council voted 7\u20132 to postpone action on the ordinance and appoint a task force. The Springfield News-Leader reported that Stephanie Perkins, deputy director of PROMO, a homosexual activist network, said the delay was better than putting the issue to a public vote, where it would likely be defeated. The city is home to the national headquarters of the Assemblies of God, the Baptist Bible Fellowship International, and three Christian colleges. The Rev. Mark Kiser, president of Reclaiming Missouri for Christ, noted that the council appeared ready to approve the ordinance mid-summer but delayed action after religious opposition emerged. \u201cIt was a huge victory [to have the vote postponed],\u201d Kiser said. \u201cBut there is a great chance that this is going to come up again, so we\u2019ll have to be ready to do this again.\u201d Similar debates are going on in Salina and Hutchinson, Kan., as well as in Omaha, Neb., which narrowly passed an ordinance in March extending legal protections to homosexual and transgender residents. A tie vote scuttled a similar attempt in October 2010. In Lincoln, Neb., Family First and the Nebraska Family Council collected more than 10,000 signatures challenging a \u201cfairness amendment\u201d approved by the city council in May. The petition forced the city either to let the ordinance die or submit it for voter approval. Officials declined to put it on the November ballot or specify when it might appear. One factor, said the news item, may have been that in August a former star on the University of Nebraska women\u2019s basketball team pleaded not guilty after police filed charges against her for allegedly faking an anti-gay attack. Police said she carved a cross onto her chest and slurs onto her arms and abdomen because she felt it would influence debate over the amendment. The woman crawled naked and bleeding from her Lincoln home, screaming for help on July 22, but on July 18 she had outlined in a Facebook posting what investigators believe was her motive for faking the attack, Police Chief Jim Peschong said at a news conference.\nWestern spy agencies suspect Syria\u2019s government has several hundred tons of chemical weapons and precursor components scattered among as many as 20 sites throughout the country, heightening anxieties about the ability to secure the arsenals in the event of a complete breakdown of authority in the war-torn nation, reports Worthy News and The Washington Post. Officials are monitoring the storage sites, but they expressed growing fear that they have not identified every location and that some of the deadly weapons could be stolen or used by Syrian troops against civilians. \u201cWe think we know everything, but we felt the same way about Libya,\u201d said a former American intelligence official who was briefed on U.S. preparations for both conflicts. \u201cWe had been on the ground in Libya, yet there were big surprises, both in terms of quantities and locations.\u201d The former official was one of several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information.\nPosted in Commentary, Culture, GARBC Blog Feed on September 7, 2012.\n", "prompt": "World News Sept. 7: After excluding God from their platform, Democrats hurriedly rewrote their convention platform Wednesday amid criticism to add a mention of God and declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel.

This is AAT level 4 you need to have an up to date CV a covering letter an evidence section in which you have to keep all your evidence together, this means for every task you've done in a business you have to keep a copy of that letter that you've sent in and proof that you sent it in. The last section is your portfolio which needs to be well organised and easy to find.\nMy biggest advice is to do it as you go along, every time you write an invoice or a letter you must save it in your evidence section and write a short summary of what you have done and why. You can also use your evidence section to show them what a good job you have done and your work ethic. I know that the evidence section is a hard part, but what I did was every time I completed a task for the business I sent it to an email and sent a copy to my manager and saved them all. When you want to show them something in your portfolio you simply copy and paste the email onto a template they will give you.\nAlso you should keep the original emails and not delete them. You must have your portfolio in a folder called portfolio. So I have a folder on my desktop which is my email inbox, this is where I save all my emails, when I do the tasks I get them in a folder called portfolio. In this folder I make all my documents that I have done as evidence. This is where your manager or the people at AAT want to see all your evidence. This is what will be submitted to the AAT and what I would recommend is that you save every piece of correspondence onto a template and don't use the same template twice. The same with your CV and covering letter. Remember to write a cover letter with every email and use the same format and font throughout. Also don't worry if you don't do as well as you think you should. Just remember it is your first time doing this and you are doing so well because it is a lot of pressure doing this.\nI would recommend doing it like that, as you keep all your documents under one name, the same document for correspondence and for tasks. Also try to set goals for yourself and make sure that you write it down when you achieve them and have them checked by your manager.

Of course, when you see the format of the cover letter on the internet, it will be in the form of a typical cover letter.

Even though we can find a lot of information about resumes and cover letters on the internet, we still don't know how to write a cover letter. You will need a resume to apply for an internship. The difference between resumes and resumes is that resumes do not cover letters. Your resume is just a summary of your academic and job history. The main purpose is to apply for the job. If you want to make your resume and cover letter stand out, you need to write a cover letter.\n\nIf you are applying for a job via a company's website, you will need to attach your resume to the application form. The cover letter is what allows the recruiter to get to know you better. If you do not want to go into too much detail, you can only provide the contact information, the number of years of experience, a brief explanation of your strengths, and the reasons for applying for the job you are looking for. This is the best cover letter for an entry-level position.\n\nWhat is the difference between the application form and the resume? It mainly depends on whether or not there is a cover letter in the application form. If there is a cover letter in the application form, it means that the application form is not complete and must be attached to the resume. The resume must include a cover letter. If you only have an application form to send, you need to prepare a resume.\n\nIn the cover letter, you need to express why you are interested in working for the company you are applying for. There are usually three reasons for applying for a job: the work itself, the position you are applying for, and the company you are", "completion_only": "The idea regarding how your resume should be designed is going to be a haiku.

If you do not want to go into too much detail, you can only provide the contact information, the number of years of experience, a brief explanation of your strengths, and the reasons for applying for the job you are looking for. This is the best cover letter for an entry-level position.\n\nWhat is the difference between the application form and the resume? It mainly depends on whether or not there is a cover letter in the application form. If there is a cover letter in the application form, it means that the application form is not complete and must be attached to the resume. The resume must include a cover letter. If you only have an application form to send, you need to prepare a resume.\n\nIn the cover letter, you need to express why you are interested in working for the company you are applying for. There are usually three reasons for applying for a job: the work itself, the position you are applying for, and the company you are", "model": "allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B", "completion_idx": 130, "avg_token_entropy": 1.5978687999993562, "avg_token_perplexity": 7.73207468482614, "prompt_type": "random_doc"}
